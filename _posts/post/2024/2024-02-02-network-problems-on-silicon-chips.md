As Apple's Silicon processors have gained significant attention in the tech community, many users have reported significant stability and network performance issues. These problems are particularly noticeable when using Wi-Fi on the 2.4 GHz band or connecting via a USB dongle for LAN.

Users have expressed concerns over the reliability of their devices, especially when it comes to maintaining stable connections. The shift from Intel to Apple Silicon has been met with enthusiasm due to the performance enhancements these processors offer, yet the transition has not been without its challenges. Many users have noted that while the overall performance of their Macs has improved, specific functionalities, particularly those related to network connectivity, have suffered.

## Overview of Network Issues

One common complaint among users is the sudden and prolonged drops in transfer rates, leading to frustrating experiences. These issues can often be attributed to the design of the network card in these devices, which may struggle to maintain consistent performance under certain conditions.

When operating on the 2.4 GHz band, devices with Silicon processors may experience exceptionally low transfer rates, sometimes as low as 0.5 Mbps ðŸ˜±. This is significantly lower than expected, and while not all devices are necessarily affected, numerous complaints have surfaced online.

For instance, I experienced a connection that was about 30 times faster when using my MacBook Pro 2019 compared to the M1 Pro. Simple benchmarks using the **`networkQuality`** command revealed the following results:

### Benchmark Results

**M1 Pro Internet Speed:**
- **Downlink:** 0.568 Mbps
- **Uplink:** 1.920 Mbps

**Intel-based Internet Speed:**
- **Downlink:** 14.347 Mbps
- **Uplink:** 4.175 Mbps

Such results were shocking, especially considering I do not have fiber internet and rely on 4G. ðŸ¤£

Initially, I suspected that VPN or MDM settings on the M1 Pro were causing these significant speed drops. However, further research led me to useful findings that helped restore speed on my M1 Pro device.

## Understanding Frequency Bands

The 2.4 GHz band offers better coverage and penetration through walls but is more susceptible to interference from other devices and nearby Wi-Fi networks. This can lead to congestion and speed drops, especially in crowded areas. Conversely, the 5 GHz band is generally faster and less prone to interference, although it has a shorter range and may struggle to penetrate solid objects.

Additionally, connecting to a LAN via a USB dongle (especially when a monitor is connected to the same dongle) has been reported to cause network performance issues, complicating the challenges faced by users who rely on stable and high-speed connections.

## Proposed Solutions

While these problems may seem daunting, there are several potential workarounds and solutions that users can consider:

### 1. Utilize Safe Mode for Diagnostics

When troubleshooting network performance issues on devices with Silicon processors, using the **`networkQuality`** command in safe mode can be a valuable diagnostic tool. Safe mode loads only essential components, allowing users to isolate potential software conflicts or third-party applications that may be impacting network performance. Running the **`networkQuality`** command in this environment can provide a clearer picture of the device's network status.

### 2. Switch to the 5 GHz Band

Switching to the 5 GHz band and disabling the 2.4 GHz network on your router can be an effective strategy for addressing performance issues. Additionally, using a 40 MHz channel width can help mitigate congestion and interference, resulting in improved network performance. This simple change can often make a noticeable difference in the reliability and speed of the Wi-Fi network for devices with Silicon processors.

### 3. Consider Wi-Fi Over USB-C Dongles

If you are using a USB-C dongle for network connectivity and experiencing issues, consider switching to Wi-Fi as an alternative. Assess the network quality using **`networkQuality`** to compare the performance of the USB-C dongle with that of the Wi-Fi connection. This approach can help identify specific issues related to the dongle or the network environment.

### 4. Disable Unused Network Features

Disabling unnecessary network features such as "Thunderbolt Bridge," which allows high-speed data transfer between two Mac computers using Thunderbolt ports, may also help. Users have reported that disabling features they do not use can resolve network performance issues.

## Conclusion

It's crucial to be aware of these potential network performance issues when using devices with Silicon processors. While not all devices may be affected, many users have shared similar complaints. I hope this information proves helpful for those navigating network performance challenges on Silicon powered devices. 

By following the proposed solutions, users may find improved network stability and performance, enhancing their overall experience with these powerful machines.
