## Bitwise Operators in Swift
Operators for performing bit-level operations on integers, useful for low-level programming and efficient data manipulation.

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `&` | **(Bitwise AND)**: Performs a bitwise AND operation between two integers. Each bit in the result is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of both operands are 1. |
| `|` | **(Bitwise OR)**: Performs a bitwise OR operation between two integers. Each bit in the result is set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits of either operand is 1. |
| `^` | **(Bitwise XOR)**: Performs a bitwise XOR operation between two integers. Each bit in the result is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of the operands are different. |
| `~` | **(Bitwise NOT)**: Performs a bitwise NOT operation on a single integer. This operator inverts all the bits of the operand, turning 0s into 1s and 1s into 0s. |
| `<<` | **(Left Shift)**: Shifts the bits of an integer to the left by a specified number of positions. This operation effectively multiplies the integer by 2 for each position shifted. |
| `>>` | **(Right Shift)**: Shifts the bits of an integer to the right by a specified number of positions. This operation effectively divides the integer by 2 for each position shifted. |
| `&=` | **(Bitwise AND Assignment)**: Combines the bitwise AND operation with assignment. It updates the variable by performing a bitwise AND between its current value and another value. |
| `|=` | **(Bitwise OR Assignment)**: Combines the bitwise OR operation with assignment. It updates the variable by performing a bitwise OR between its current value and another value. |
| `^=` | **(Bitwise XOR Assignment)**: Combines the bitwise XOR operation with assignment. It updates the variable by performing a bitwise XOR between its current value and another value. |

These operators are applied to integer types (`Int`, `UInt`, etc.) and provide a way to perform efficient, low-level bit manipulation in Swift. They are especially useful in scenarios where performance and direct hardware interaction are critical.
