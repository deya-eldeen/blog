A reserved word is¬†**a word that cannot be used as an identifier**, this is a syntactic definition, as mentioned before in [Swift Lexical Structure](https://swiftbydeya.com/swift-lexical-structure/), all lists below are written alphabetically.

- Keywords used in declarations:¬†

| Reserved Word | Details |
| --- | --- |
| associatedtype | Associated types are a powerful way of making protocols generic, it¬†gives a placeholder name to a type that‚Äôs used as part of the protocol. |
| class | One of swift's general purpose, flexible constructs  
also see **struct** |
| deinit | A method that gets automatically called when an object is freed up from memory by ARC. |
| enum | Enums let's you define a custom kind of value in Swift, with predefined possible values. |
| extension | Extensions¬†add new functionality to an existing class, structure, enumeration, or protocol type. |
| fileprivate | One of swift's access modifiers. |
| func | Used for creating functions. |
| import | A declaration used for importing modules and submodules |
| init | as per swift documentation, "Initialization¬†is the process of preparing an instance of a class, structure, or enumeration for use." |
| inout | inout allows parameters to be changed outside of the function scope. |
| internal | One of swift's access modifiers. |
| let | A keyword used for declaring a constant |
| open | One of swift's access modifiers. |
| operator | A special symbol/ phrase that you use to check, change, or combine values. |
| private | One of swift's access modifiers. |
| precedencegroup | defining precedence groups to use for our custom operators. |
| protocol | as per swift's official documentation "A¬†protocol¬†defines a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality." |
| public | One of swift's access modifiers. |
| rethrows | rethrows keyword is used with function that accepts a throwing function as a parameter. |
| static | defines a static scope. |
| struct | complex value-types. |
| subscript | Subscripts allow you to write shortcuts to elements from collections, Sequences in classes, structures and enumerations. |
| typealias | Defines an alias for an existing type. |
| var | A keyword used for declaring a variable. |

- Keywords used in statements:

| Reserved Word | Details |
| --- | --- |
| break | One of the control transfer statements, ends execution of a loop, an if statement, or a switch statement. |
| case | Used for pattern testing. |
| catch | Used for handling any potential errors caused by a function that throws. |
| continue | One of the control transfer statements, ends execution of the current iteration of a loop statement but does not stop execution of the loop statement. |
| default | Used for default cases in switch. |
| defer | Used for making a block to execute just before a function exits. |
| do | Used for creating do blocks, for example (do-while, do-catch) |
| else | Used for executing a block when a condition is not satisfied. |
| fallthrough | One of the control transfer statements |
| for | Used for iterating over a sequence. |
| guard | Used in control transfer statement and optional unwrapping. |
| if | Used for condition evaluation. |
| in | In is a keyword defined in the Swift closure syntax as a separator between the function type and the function body in a closure, and used in checking if an object is in a sequence. |
| repeat | A control flow statement, similar to while loop |
| return | One of the control transfer statements |
| throw | Used for throwing an error in a function that throws. |
| switch | A switch statement considers a value and compares it against several possible matching patterns. |
| where | Used to filter out values, in statements like switch, for, protocol extension, first, contains, initializers. |
| while | A control flow statement, it performs a set of statements until a condition becomes false |

- Keywords used in expressions and types:

| Reserved Word | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Any | Any can represent an instance of any type at all, including function types. |
| as | Used for type casting. |
| catch | Used in error handling, when an error is thrown, it‚Äôs matched against the catch clauses. |
| false | A literal used to express booleans. |
| is | Used to check whether an object is of a certain class type |
| nil | A valueless state that could be assigned to optionals. |
| rethrows | allows forwarding a thrown error by a given function parameter |
| self | ‚Äúself‚Äù refers to the current object within a class or struct. |
| Self | Refers to a type ‚Äì usually the current type in the current context. |
| super | super is used to call up to your superclass. |
| throw | Used for throwing an error in a function that throws. |
| throws | To mark a function throwing. |
| true | A literal used to express booleans. |
| try | The try keyword is used to indicate that a method can throw an error. To catch and handle an error, the throwing method call needs to be wrapped in a do-catch statement. |
