You are writing an application that has a long list of entries, with each entry containing an image, the total download size of all images is about 10 MB, but the images take around 200 ~ 300 MB on RAM, you wonder why üßê?

RAM normally does not understand images that are compressed, they are stored as raw bitmaps, even if the image is compressed, it gets inflated into memory as a raw image.  
  
Image Size on RAM = (pixels height √ó pixels width √ó color depth bytes)  
  
The following image takes around 300 KB on disk and has an sRGB color profile, which is 24 bits (8 bits per channel).`   `

The size of the image on the RAM would be:

`Image Size on RAM = (1665‚Ää √ó ‚Ää2081 √ó 3) bytes = 9.8MB`

In Swift, [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher "Kingfisher") comes with an option to downsize images according to the screen scale, so you can have images in a reasonable size even if they come largely from the server.

```
import UIKit
import Kingfisher

extension UIImageView {
    
    func setImageAsThumb(url:String) {
        let formattedURL = url.addingPercentEncoding(withAllowedCharacters: .urlQueryAllowed) ?? ""
        let scale = UIScreen.main.scale
        let resizingProcessor = ResizingImageProcessor(referenceSize: CGSize(width: 50.0 * scale, height: 50.0 * scale))
        self.kf.setImage(with: URL(string: formattedURL), placeholder: nil, options: [.processor(resizingProcessor)])
    }

}
```
