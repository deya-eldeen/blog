Void is a data type that is common across a lot of programming languages, in Swift's standard library, it's simply an empty tuple, it's used for for functions that return nothing, when defining a function, if you don't specify a return type, you get a function that return Void, this is how it's defined in standard library.

```
public typealias Void = ()
```

You use Void to declare the type of a function, method, or closure, Keep in mind ðŸ¤“  
that () can mean two things:  
  
`()`Â can be a type - the empty tuple type, **which is the same asÂ `Void`.**  
`()`Â can be a value - an empty tuple, **which is the same asÂ `Void()`.**
