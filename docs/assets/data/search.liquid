One common complaint is sudden long drops in transfer rates, often resulting in frustrating experiences for users. These issues can be attributed to the design of the network card in these devices, which may struggle to maintain consistent performance under certain conditions.When operating on the 2.4 GHz band, devices with M1 or M2 processors may experience very low transfer rates like 0.5 mbps transfer rate 😱, significantly lower than expected, not all the devices are necessarily affected, but a lot of complaints about this can be found.I had a connection about 30 times faster when connecting through my macbook pro 2019 than M1 Pro, simple benchmarks using networkQuality command.**M1 Pro based internet speed**Downlink: 0.568 Mbps, 31 RPM - Uplink: 1.920 Mbps, 36 RPM_**Intel based internet speed**_Downlink: 14.347 Mbps, 63 RPM - Uplink: 4.175 Mbps, 47 RPMSuch results were shocking to me 😱, maybe you are also in shock to the 15 Mbps speed of mine as I don’t have fiber-internet where I live and still on 4G. 🤣In the beginning I was suspecting that the VPN/MDM on the M1 Pro to be why I have sudden significant long speed drops, but after doing some research I found some useful findings that helped me retrieve the speed back on M1 Pro device.The 2.4GHz band offers a better coverage and penetration through walls. However, it is more suspectible to interference from other devices &amp;amp; nearby Wi-Fi networks. This can potentially lead to congestion and speed drops, especially in crowded areas. On the other hand, the 5GHz band is generally faster and is less susceptible to interference. However, it has a shorter range and may have more difficulty penetrating objects.Connecting to a LAN via a USB dongle (specially with a monitor on the same dongle) is also reported to lead to network performance issues, further complicating the challenges faced by users relying on a stable and high-speed network connection.While these problems may seem daunting, there are potential workarounds and solutions that users can consider.1- When troubleshooting network performance issues on devices with M1 or M2 processors, utilizing the “networkQuality” command in safe mode can be a valuable diagnostic tool. By entering safe mode, the system loads only essential components, allowing users to isolate potential software conflicts or third-party applications that may be impacting network performance. Running the “networkQuality” command in this environment can provide a clearer picture of the device’s network status.This can help narrow down the potential sources of the issue, whether it’s related to software conflicts, driver issues, or other factors. By leveraging safe mode and the “networkQuality” command, users can gather crucial data to aid in the debugging process and work towards resolving network performance issues effectively.2- Switching to the 5 GHz band and disabling the 2.4 GHz network on your router can be an effective strategy for addressing performance issues associated with the 2.4 GHz band. Along with using 40MHz channel width, you can potentially mitigate the impact of congestion and interference, resulting in improved network performance.This simple change can often make a noticeable difference in the overall reliability and speed of the Wi-Fi network for devices with M1 or M2 processors.3- If you find yourself using a USB-C dongle for network connectivity using LAN and you are experiencing network issues, it may be worth considering a switch to Wi-Fi as an alternative. By transitioning to Wi-Fi, you can assess the network quality using “networkQuality”, This approach allows you to compare the performance of the USB-C dongle with that of the Wi-Fi connection, potentially identifying any specific issues related to the dongle or the network environment.4- disable needless network features such as “Thunderbolt Bridge” which is a networking technology that allows for high-speed data transfer between two Mac computers using Thunderbolt ports. Consider disabling this feature and other features that you don’t use, disabling these is reported to solve the issue.It’s important to be aware of these potential network performance issues when using devices with M1 or M2 processors. some devices could be not affected by these issues, but I saw a lot of people complaining about the same, I hope this information proves helpful to those navigating network performance issues on M1 and M2 powered devices." }, { "title" : "Test Doubles In Swift (Part 1)", "category" : "", "tags" : " Development, iOS, Programming, Swift", "url" : "/blog/test-doubles-in-swift-part-1", "date" : "October 25, 2023", "excerpt" : "Test doubles name is inspired by “stunt doubles” from movies industry.Testing is an essential part of software development, allowing us to ensure the correctness and reliability of our code.

However, when it comes to writing tests, one concept that often perplexes developers is the use of test doubles, test doubles are objects that replace dependencies in our code during testing, enabling us to isolate and verify specific behaviors.In general, there are various types of test doubles, such as dummies, fakes, stubs, spies, and mocks, understanding when and how to use each type can greatly enhance the effectiveness of our tests and improve the overall quality of our code.In this blog post series, we will delve into the world of test doubles in Swift, exploring their purpose, distinctions, and practical examples, by the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of how to leverage test doubles to write comprehensive and reliable tests.A test double is an object that stands in for a real dependency during testing, these dependencies, such as external services, databases, or complex components, can introduce complexity and make testing challenging, test doubles help us isolate the code under test and focus on specific behaviors, making our tests more reliable and efficient.Test doubles are designed to mimic the behavior of real objects, but they provide simplified or controlled implementations, by replacing real dependencies with test doubles, we can create predictable and controlled environments for testing, without relying on external systems or complex setups." }, { "title" : "iOS Accessibility Series (Part 1)", "category" : "", "tags" : " Development, iOS, Programming, Swift", "url" : "/blog/ios-accessibility-series-part-1", "date" : "August 2, 2023", "excerpt" : "iOS accessibility, from a developer’s point of view, refers to the set of tools, technologies, and guidelines provided by Apple to ensure that iOS applications are usable and inclusive for people with disabilities.

As a developer, incorporating accessibility features into your iOS app involves considering the diverse needs of users with visual, auditory, motor, cognitive, and any other impairments. (see table below for a list of most common impairments and disabilities)Many developers and businesses do not prioritize making their applications accessible for several reasons, first, there is often a lack of awareness about the significance of accessibility and the benefits it brings to a broader user base, second, some developers perceive accessibility implementation as a complex and time-consuming task, leading them to prioritize other features instead, there are also other concerns about additional costs, limited resources, the assumption that their target audience does not include people with disabilities can deter developers from investing in accessibility.Legal enforcement of accessibility regulations may be weak or inconsistent in some regions, reducing the incentive to comply, moreover, the emphasis on aesthetics over accessibility, inadequate training on accessibility best practices, and resistance to change can further hinder the adoption of accessible design, despite these challenges, raising awareness and promoting the positive impact of accessibility remain crucial in encouraging developers to make their applications inclusive and accessible to all users.Several countries have enacted laws and regulations to enforce digital accessibility. In the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 outline accessibility requirements for websites, applications, and other digital content provided by federal agencies and entities receiving federal funding.The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), created by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), are widely recognized as the global standard for web accessibility, these guidelines provide specific criteria for making digital content accessible to individuals with disabilities.Failure to comply with accessibility regulations and standards can lead to legal consequences. Companies and organizations that do not provide accessible digital content may face complaints, lawsuits, or enforcement actions by individuals, advocacy groups, or government agencies.Penalties can include fines, legal fees, court orders to rectify accessibility issues, and reputational damage.Several high-profile cases have set important precedents for digital accessibility enforcement, resulting in settlements or court rulings against companies that were found to have inaccessible websites or applications, these cases highlight the significance of accessibility and the legal ramifications of non-compliance.Numerous prominent cases have established crucial precedents for enforcing digital accessibility, leading to settlements or court rulings against companies with inaccessible websites or applications. Notably, Domino’s Pizza, Netflix, and Target faced legal issues related to the lack of accessible applications for individuals with disabilities. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of a blind plaintiff, stating that the ADA applies to websites and mobile apps. Netflix settled with the National Association of the Deaf, agreeing to make its streaming content accessible with closed captions. Similarly, Target settled with the National Federation of the Blind, committing to enhance its website’s accessibility.These cases emphasize the significance of digital accessibility and the legal consequences for non-compliance, prompting businesses to increasingly prioritize accessibility for a more inclusive online environment.Main types of disabilities and impairments:VisualUsers with visual impairments may have a partial or complete loss of vision. They rely on assistive technologies like VoiceOver to navigate the app using spoken feedback. Developers must ensure that UI elements have meaningful labels, provide appropriate descriptions, and support dynamic text sizes for better readability. Additionally, maintaining proper contrast and avoiding reliance on color-only cues is crucial to aid users with low vision.When creating an accessible app, developers should consider various visual impairments, such as blindness, low vision, color blindness, glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration, nystagmus, diabetic retinopathy, hemianopia, and photophobia.To accommodate users with these conditions, designers should prioritize VoiceOver support, dynamic text sizing, high contrast options, and clear layouts. Regular accessibility testing with assistive technologies ensures the app meets the needs of all users, providing an inclusive experience for those with visual challenges.AuditoryUsers with auditory impairments experience hearing loss, which can range from mild to profound. Closed captioning and subtitles are essential for video or audio content to make it accessible to this audience. Developers should also consider providing visual or haptic feedback for important alerts or notifications.MotorUsers with motor impairments may have difficulty with precise touch gestures or using physical buttons. To accommodate these users, developers should ensure that app elements are well-spaced and have an appropriate touch target size. Supporting alternative input methods like switch control and voice commands can also enhance accessibility for users with motor challenges.CognitiveUsers with cognitive impairments may face challenges with memory, attention, and problem-solving. To cater to this audience, developers should strive for simplicity and clarity in the app&#39;s user interface. Avoiding complex navigation flows and providing clear instructions can make the app more user-friendly for individuals with cognitive disabilities.SpeechUsers with speech impairments may have difficulty communicating through traditional speech. Developers can consider integrating communication tools or support for alternative input methods like text-to-speech or augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) into their apps.Situational disabilitiesUsers in certain situations, such as noisy environments or poor lighting conditions, may benefit from accessibility features like closed captioning or larger text sizes." }, { "title" : "SwiftUI views are values and not objects!", "category" : "", "tags" : " Development, iOS, Programming, Swift", "url" : "/blog/swiftui-views-are-values-and-not-objects-overlooking-this-can-lead-to-bugs", "date" : "May 19, 2023", "excerpt" : "In SwiftUI, views are value types rather than traditional objects 🧐, this design approach is a fundamental aspect of SwiftUI’s declarative programming model and is aligned with the Swift language’s emphasis on value semantics. As value ty...", "content" : "In SwiftUI, views are value types rather than traditional objects 🧐, this design approach is a fundamental aspect of SwiftUI’s declarative programming model and is aligned with the Swift language’s emphasis on value semantics. As value types, views in SwiftUI are immutable and are copied when needed, resulting in predictable behavior and easy management of state and data flow, this means that when you modify a view, you are actually creating a new instance with the desired changes, rather than mutating the existing view, this immutability allows SwiftUI to efficiently track changes and perform targeted updates to the user interface.Value types promote a more functional and declarative style of programming, where you describe the desired state and SwiftUI takes care of updating the view hierarchy accordingly, they are also thread-safe by default, as copies are made when passing views between different execution contexts.Another advantage of using value types for views is that they enable SwiftUI’s built-in animations and transitions, by comparing the old and new values of a view, SwiftUI can automatically animate the changes, resulting in smooth and visually appealing user interface updates.The declarative programming paradigm is at the core of its design philosophy, declarative programming focuses on describing the desired state of the user interface rather than specifying step-by-step instructions on how to achieve that state, SwiftUI’s view tree engine leverages this approach to efficiently manage and update the user interface based on changes in the underlying state.You define your user interface using a hierarchy of composable and reusable views. Each view represents a specific part of the interface and is responsible for rendering itself based on the current state, by composing these views together, you create a tree-like structure known as the view hierarchy, the view hierarchy in SwiftUI is immutable, meaning that you define it once and SwiftUI takes care of updating it based on changes to the underlying state, when the state changes, (or even when the view re-appears when scrolling back and forth), SwiftUI re-evaluates the view hierarchy and determines the minimal set of updates needed to reflect the new state, this process is known as the reconciliation algorithm (AKA diffing algorithm).The reconciliation algorithm is where SwiftUI’s view tree engine shines. It efficiently compares the old and new view hierarchies, identifies the differences, and applies the necessary updates to the user interface, by only updating the specific parts of the view hierarchy that have changed, SwiftUI minimizes the amount of work needed to keep the UI in sync with the state, resulting in optimal performance.In contrast to UIKit, in SwiftUI view construction and updates are unified into a single code path, views are values rather than objects, described by values conforming to the View protocol, the view tree is transient and can be recreated at any time based on the underlying state, this declarative approach eliminates the need for separate event handlers and manual UI updates like in UIKit, SwiftUI’s view tree engine efficiently reconciles state changes, performs targeted updates, and ensures a reactive UI that stays in sync with the data, by relying on value semantics, SwiftUI can perform granular updates and avoid unnecessary computations, leading to a highly performant and responsive user interface.By relying on a declarative approach, SwiftUI allows developers to focus on describing the desired end state of the UI rather than worrying about the low-level details of UI manipulation, this shift in mindset 😎 leads to more maintainable and expressive code, as developers can easily reason about the UI based on its desired state.Another significant aspect of SwiftUI’s view tree engine is its ability to efficiently handle updates. As views in SwiftUI are value types, changes in the state result in the creation of new view instances rather than mutating existing ones. SwiftUI employs a mechanism called “value comparison” to determine the differences between the old and new views, enabling it to perform targeted updates to the UI.Additionally, SwiftUI’s view tree engine embraces a reactive programming model. Views in SwiftUI are not just passive representations of UI elements but are also capable of reacting to changes in the state, this reactive nature enables automatic propagation of state changes throughout the view hierarchy, ensuring that the UI remains synchronized with the underlying data.In conclusion, SwiftUI’s view tree engine revolutionizes UI development by embracing the declarative programming paradigm. It provides an efficient and responsive user interface by leveraging value types, value comparisons, and reactive programming.The ability to describe UI in a declarative manner, combined with targeted updates and optimization techniques, empowers developers to create intuitive and performant user interfaces with ease." }, { "title" : "This is why I don&#39;t use GIT GUI tools.", "category" : "", "tags" : " Development, iOS, Programming, Swift", "url" : "/blog/this-is-why-i-dont-use-git-gui-tools", "date" : "January 30, 2023", "excerpt" : "Any seasoned iOS engineer who uses Xcode can see that it lacks a lot of git features, which is OK as it’s not mainly a source control application.

I’m sure I can think of dozens of cases, but let’s keep this post small.. I will list the commands I use, so you can have an idea about the more power we can have in terminal.1- PR Reverts: a feature introduced by Github, PR reverts, say you have an already merged pull request, and you want to revert it before a tight-deadline like a branch cut, using Github’s revert feature will not ask about details of commits to be removed, it most probably will remove commits that were merged in the PR, so you may easily end up removing extra stuff that is irrelevant by accident.But using such command, you will have fine-grained control about what commit to remove or keep.git revert --no-commit someHash 2- Submodules: if you have nested git repos (submodules), such feature maybe not be existent in most GUI tools.I normally have terminal open all day, and I can’t live without it 🧐, I hate to push buttons without knowing exactly what each button does, tools can come and go, the CLI will be always what GUI tools are built on.It’s convenient to set up install scripts, build scripts, deploy scripts, etc.. when working on a large team, one will have no idea what exactly happens in the GUI based app, and in the old times I’ve seen colleagues do bad things impossible to restore without the CLI 🤦🏻.I feel several times faster using the command line than clicking through with a mouse.GIT GUI tools were meant to mitigate complexity, but to me, they seem to add more complexity if the project is large, I once seen non-git standard terminology, which normally makes things harder in general.PS: the only real use of source control in Xcode is the diffing tools, it visualizes diffs perfectly. 🤓git addgit annotategit bisectgit blamegit checkoutgit checkout -bgit cherry-pickgit clean -fdxgit clonegit clone --single-branchgit commitgit commit --amend -m &quot;New commit message.&quot;git configgit diffgit diff --checkgit fetchgit gcgit initgit loggit log --allgit log --onelinegit log --summarygit log -pgit mergegit pull --rebasegit pushgit push --set-upstream origingit push -u origin feature_branch_namegit rebasegit remote -avgit remote addgit reset --hardgit restoregit revertgit rmgit shortloggit showgit stashgit stash listgit stash popgit statusgit taggit worktreecommon git commands that I use (sorted alphabetically)" }, { "title" : "Why I prefer to store my files on a digital ocean space &amp; not google drive or dropbox.", "category" : "", "tags" : " Development, iOS, Programming, Swift", "url" : "/blog/backup-on-spaces", "date" : "January 21, 2023", "excerpt" : "This is not directly related to swift or iOS, but thought it’s worth sharing, since I couldn’t find any article that mention such way to backup files.

the way you do it will break the first criteria “Fast”, the normal time for tests is something like 50ms or something.Unit Tests Criteria “F.I.R.S.T”:**Fast**: we can run dozens of them in a second, if not more **Isolated**: should not depend on each other, or any external state. **Repeatable**: they should always give the same result when they are run, like a pure function. **Self-Verifying**: the test must unambiguously say whether it passed or failed, with no room for interpretation. **Timely**: they should be written before or alongside the production code that you are testing.(Penguin 🐧): But we must have high test coverage, like 100% coverage to cover all cases, don’t we?(Rex 🦖): Test coverage means coverage on the code logic itself, like the percentage of lines tested, not on the “possible values coverage”, and by the way, test coverage is a flawed metric, it only means we have test functions that call our code, it does not mean that the test functions are good.(Penguin 🐧): Good, yeah, any other benefits for having unit tests?(Rex 🦖): Testing reduces maintenance costs and therefore quantity of bugs, there are also other costs to consider like customer impact, the longer an issue goes undiscovered, the more expensive it is, which can result in negative reviews &amp;amp; lost trust, and of course lost money!(Penguin 🐧): But why follow TDD (Test Driven Development) methodology? why write the tests before writing the feature itself?(Rex 🦖): There are a lot of other development methodologies, like TDD, ATDD, DDD, BDD, .. these are lengthy topic, I encourage you to read about them quickly, and the RGR lifecycle of TDD.(Penguin 🐧): That’s really cool, how can I make sure my code is testable? and what makes it not?(Rex 🦖): You may consider architectural patterns, that make code more separated and easily tested, like MVVM, VIPER, VIP, …, FRP may make your code easier to test, using dependency injection, and coordinator pattern, using pure functions, etc…(Penguin 🐧): So I always need to mock stuff when testing, right?(Rex 🦖): No, Mocks are type of test doubles, there are also Fakes, Stubs, Spies, Dummies, look them up, and know when to use each, they are so confusing at first.![](images/test_doubles.jpg)When we say test doubles, the name is derived from stunt doubles(Penguin 🐧): what other tips do you have?(Rex 🦖): yes, there are a few on top of my head- In network testing for mobile in general, no HTTP request should be made, you test the networking feature it self.- tests run alphabetically, you should not rename your tests to change their order of running, remember that tests should be independent, changing the order intentionally will break this criteria.- Xcode provides performance tests, that compares between previous runs, where you can also change the baseline, it also gives nicely formatted test coverage markers.- Writing no tests is better than writing flaky tests!" }, { "title" : "Refresher: Problem Solving (1-4)", "category" : "", "tags" : " Development, iOS, Programming, Swift, Math, Algorithms", "url" : "/blog/problem_solving_swift_1_4", "date" : "November 16, 2022", "excerpt" : "After reading the very popular book, grokking algorithms,Will be blogging about algorithms and data structures… the book is very informative and easy to digest.

I can see we spend big money on security.🦖: There are over 500 reported incidents of data-breach each year, It’s estimated that each incident costs 3.5M~5.0M USD on average.If you look at statistics, you can see that remote jobs increased these costs by 15%, since attackers would have more opportunities of attacking a target that is spread on different locations.👩🏼‍💻: When people talk about security, the server is being presented as the main defense line, why would a mobile developer be concerned with security if the server/website is secure?🦖: Even if a website is securely developed and maintained, mobile apps still need to implement security best practices, while the server plays an important role, the client-side code in a mobile app can potentially expose users to risks if not developed securely, if the client is poorly written, you should expect a lot of attacks on the server.Mobile apps have direct access to users’ sensitive data like location, contacts, files etc. on their devices, if an app is compromised, it could leak private user information, unlike browsers, mobile apps run locally on devices without the same protections of a browser sandbox, so vulnerabilities in app code could allow malicious actors to directly attack the device.Many mobile attacks happen by exploiting vulnerabilities in how apps download and execute code. Developers need to ensure app updates and payloads come from verified, untampered sources.As users spend more time in apps than browsers, mobile presents a larger attack surface. Security needs to be a priority throughout the development and deployment process on both frontend and backend.👩🏼‍💻: But you are an iOS developer, and I develop for Android, would your tips and hints be applicable to Android too? oh, I almost forgot that both are based on Linux.🦖: wait, they are not both based on Linux, iOS is a Unix-like Operating System which is based on Darwin(BSD) operating system, while Android is Linux-based Operating System and is an open source mobile operating system, there are a lot of precautions that are applicable on both OSs.👩🏼‍💻: I was asking myself in the past, why not rely on HTTPS and that’s it?🦖: HTTPS protects your data in transit between your client application to the server, but only if you can validate the TLS certificate has not been compromised.👩🏼‍💻: What are the mobile weak points? what can be hacked?🦖: Network , Disk, USB Port, etc…👩🏼‍💻: That looks like a lot of terminology, can you explain the basics?🦖: You will be good to go if you know these as a start.TermBasic Explanation.Authenticationestablish a user’s identityAuthorizationgrant a user an access to a resource, look up the difference between Authorization and AuthenticationCryptographythe study of concepts like Encryption, decryption.Encryptionmeans of securing digital data using one or more mathematical techniques, along with a password or &quot;key&quot; used to decrypt the informationDecryptionthe conversion of encrypted data to its original form.Hashinga hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, used mainly for fingerprinting.Forensicsa branch of digital forensic science pertaining to evidence found in computers and digital storage media.Sniffingprocess of monitoring and capturing all data packets passing through given networkHTTPSHypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, a web protocolSSLSecure Sockets LayerTLSTransport Layer Security (TLS)IP SpoofingIP spoofing is the creation of Internet Protocol (IP) packets which have a modified source address in order to either hide the identity of the senderReverse Engineeringis a process in which software, machines, aircraft, architectural structures and other products are deconstructed to extract design information from them.MITMMan in the middle, it’s a type of a cyber attack where they secretly relay and possibly alter the data&amp;nbsp;between two parties.XSSCross Site Scripting (XSS)SQL Injection:Read About it here.OWASPOpen Web Application Security Project (OWASP)MASVSMobile Application Security Verification Standard, it’s a sister project of OWASP Mobile Security testing guide.Binarya non-text encoded fileMach-O binaryUnder NeXTSTEP, OPENSTEP, macOS, and iOS, multiple Mach-O files can be combined in a multi-architecture binaryBasic Terminology👩🏼‍💻: Why would people with a jailbroken device be a threat on the app itself, a jailbreak only make the user hackable, right?🦖: No, The best practice, is to prevent people with Jailbroken devices from running your app, see my x04_checker repo, iOS Developers can use it to prevent jailbroken devices from running their applications.Jailbreaking is the process of exploiting the flaws of a locked-down electronic device to install software other than what the manufacturer has made available for that device. It allows the owner to gain full access to the root of the operating system and access all the features, you must know that 100% jailbreak detection is not possible, we need to make (bypassing jailbreak detection) time-consuming, because an attacker can steal the developer info, and thus steal the app info.Say a banking app has insufficient security on a jailbroken phone that is compromised, it could result in costly consequences for the banking app operator. For instance, if a user’s money is stolen due to their mobile banking app being hacked as a result of the jailbroken phone, the bank may need to reimburse the user even though it was not necessarily the bank’s fault.This is because banks often guarantee protection of users’ money from theft, so a breach of security on the mobile app that enables theft could trigger the bank’s reimbursement responsibilities regardless of the root cause being the jailbroken phone.Similarly, social media or other apps with user accounts could face defamation lawsuits if inadequate security on a compromised mobile app allows hackers to use a user’s account without their consent due to the jailbroken phone.In such scenarios, the app operator may have to bear costs due to reputational or legal risks, despite the primary vulnerability being the jailbroken phone.👩🏼‍💻: They say debugging and print statements can be a security vulnerability, is this true?🦖: Print normally only works on development builds, print will still send the data to the usb interface.As you mentioned print, It’s a heavy command though, even if your debugging device is not connected in debug mode with Xcode, leaving print statement of heavy objects might make your app slower during development, but anyway, this is not our topic.Keep in mind, NSLog will be left even in Distribution builds, any normal user can see the logs using the macOS console app, I used them when debugging opening the app using a notification when it’s terminated, this is not easy to do in Xcode directly, anyway, just use NSLog carefully, and treat the error log files with care, don’t log sensitive data, or leave trace of code symbols.With regards to logging on mobile apps, a common security concern is the potential leakage of personally identifiable information (PII) about users. Sensitive data like users’ names, financial account details, physical locations and other personal information could inadvertently be written to log files if not properly scrubbed or encrypted.This exposes the risk of PII being accessed and misused by unauthorized parties who gain access to the device’s logs. Such access could occur either after the fact if the device is stolen, or even in real-time if a hacker manages to achieve remote access. Proper handling of logging is important to prevent such PII leaks that can negatively impact users’ privacy and security.👩🏼‍💻: What about certificate pinning?🦖: Certificate pinning simply prevents people from having the victim installing an incorrect certificate and making altered requests.When implementing TLS pinning, bundling the certificate within the mobile app may not be the most suitable approach on its own. While including a default certificate is reasonable, the app should also incorporate the ability to dynamically update the pinned certificate if the server’s certificate expires or needs revocation. Any bundled certificate would also need to be encrypted in a way that prevents attackers from simply replacing the file on the device.This is to ensure the certificate can be refreshed securely over time, while an attacker cannot tamper with the pinned certificate to circumvent TLS validation. A more robust TLS pinning implementation would account for eventual certificate changes on the server through a secure update mechanism within the app.👩🏼‍💻: What about sensitive static strings?🦖: Never have your sensitive strings inside plist or any asset file, this is the most basic tip you should never miss.👩🏼‍💻: Wait Sam, I downloaded a facebook apk online, and ran a simple command to scan the binary for strings that look similar to google api keys, that begin with AIz, and I can see this, any explanation why this is not hidden in the binary? strings targetFile | grep &quot;targetString&quot;![](images/facebookstring-1024x695.jpeg)using the strings command on macos🦖: There are multiple ways google makes sure that a request is authentic, from comparing hashes, to domain binding to bundle ids etc… again, you need to have your sensitive data hidden, this is not an excuse.👩🏼‍💻: Why is it said to be risky to use 3rd party libraries when developing sensitive apps like banks?👨🏻‍💻: In normal cases, libraries are fine, just make sure that they are being audited, NPM libraries had a lot of these, for sensitive apps, it’s better to avoid them altogether.👩🏼‍💻: If I follow all of these tips, I will be completely secure?🦖: The sad news is, No, there are a lot of other attacks, like URL-scheme attacks, when you define a url scheme, your app responds to that scheme, so for instance, you create a scheme myapp://. all links starting with your scheme will directly launch your app. A universal link doesn’t include your scheme in the url but they will still launch your application, apple allows other apps to the register the same url.👩🏼‍💻: the alternative is universal links?🦖: correct!👩🏼‍💻: That was a huge amount of info for a starter, any final thoughts?🦖: 100% Security for any Application is not possible but we can try to make the attacking/cracking of iOS App as much harder as possible.Security is not always about “make accessing the data impossible”. sometimes it is about cost and likelihood of retrieval versus importance of the data.More tips on top of my head: Avoid Objective-C if possible, it’s very easy to reverse engineer. Don’t write sensitive data into logs. Disable Keyboard caching (3rd party keyboard) Password/Pin should not be exposed during user interaction - Don’t include sensitive data in backup. User Credentials should be stored in (keystore, keychain…). App Transport Security - Certificate Pinning. Integrity Check. Prevent Running on rooted devices. Detect JailBreak, (Jail Monkey library). Use WebView carefully. Securing Data on disk. Securing Data across a network connection. Secure application logic. prevent Reverse Engineering (even if there is no sensitive data, if your app is novel, you don’t want people to see the code) Don’t share sensitive data with 3rd party Avoid keywords like (“jail”,”security”,”cydia”,”apt”) in variable &amp;amp; function names Hide the JB check deep in the app, not in appdelegate… Some Jailbreaks are permanent, and are done by exploiting security flaws in hardware." }, { "title" : "GPS Hardware basics for mobile developers.", "category" : "", "tags" : " Development, iOS, Programming, Swift, Hardware, Math", "url" : "/blog/gps-hardware-basics-for-software-engineers", "date" : "March 10, 2022", "excerpt" : "Mobile software engineers (iOS and Android), are normally not familiar with how GPS works, instead of just getting Lat/Lon readings, and doing geo operations with it, why not become familiar with how GPS works? 🤓 This will not be a length...", "content" : "Mobile software engineers (iOS and Android), are normally not familiar with how GPS works, instead of just getting Lat/Lon readings, and doing geo operations with it, why not become familiar with how GPS works? 🤓 This will not be a lengthy article, it will be a chat between an iOS developer (Alex 👨🏻‍💻) and an electrical engineer (Sarah 👩🏼‍💻).👨🏻‍💻: So what does GPS stand for?👩🏼‍💻: It stands for (Global Positioning System).👨🏻‍💻: Who created it? and what for?👩🏼‍💻: The GPS project was launched in the USA back in 1973 due to limitations of old navigation systems.👨🏻‍💻: I know it works without internet, but do I need cellular service to use GPS?👩🏼‍💻: No.👨🏻‍💻: How come it works without internet or cellular service?👩🏼‍💻: You get readings from satellites, there are about 24 artificial satellites in 6 orbits.👨🏻‍💻: So a mobile needs to connect to all of these?👩🏼‍💻: Of course not, when you are stationary, you need to be exposed to 3 of them, when you are moving, you will need to be exposed to 4.![](images/ConstellationGPS.gif)GPS Satellites animation (Wikipedia)👨🏻‍💻: So how come it identifies me? and send me data?👩🏼‍💻: The Satellites don’t identify you, they only emit synchronous pulses all the time everywhere.👨🏻‍💻: And how does my mobile give me back the (latitude, longitude, and altitude)?👩🏼‍💻: It compares the receive time of these pulses from each satellite, and use calculations to determine a point on earth, since the distance between these satellites is constant, and they have atomic clocks, the calculations will not be difficult.👨🏻‍💻: The service is totally free, and I don’t have any subscription for GPS, how?👩🏼‍💻: GPS is not the only service for (Global Navigation Satellite Systems), there are many like (GLONASS, BeiDou, Galileo…), there are other commercial solutions that I don’t know much about, there are a lot of details, I heard retail GPS receivers are designed to not work if the tracked object is moving fastly, you get the idea 🧐?👨🏻‍💻: ah! yes.![](images/Beidou_Navigation_Satellite_System_2012.png)BeiDou doesn&#39;t have full earth coverage.👨🏻‍💻: What is the error margin?👩🏼‍💻: It’s variable, but you can say between 15 to 50 meters, some commercial systems use other inertial systems to give more accurate estimations.👨🏻‍💻: What is the minimum detectable value?👩🏼‍💻: You mean the resolution? theoretically, as far as I know, it’s one inch, but practically it’s about 3 meters.👨🏻‍💻: I once tried to use the GPS inside a big hospital, it didn’t serve any purpose, the readings were not accurate.👩🏼‍💻: GPS does not work indoors.👨🏻‍💻: But I saw some readings on my maps application.👩🏼‍💻: it’s the last point that was read, some devices like Huawei also augment (Accel/Gyro) sensor data, to mimic a basic INS to give your readings inside buildings, but it’s not reliable.👨🏻‍💻: And what is used for indoor navigation systems?👩🏼‍💻: They use beacons and Bluetooth and other technologies, read about apple air tags!👨🏻‍💻: You mentioned sensors, why can’t we use the basic sensors like accelerometer/gyroscope of the mobile to calculate the position?👩🏼‍💻: when you “integrate” the acceleration twice, the error will explode fastly, and it will become useless in a short time of movement, even if this works, this will not give you an absolute position, and you have to deal with drifting and gimbal lock and a lot of complexities.👨🏻‍💻: That was a lot of information, thank you.👩🏼‍💻: Welcome!, see you soon." }, { "title" : "Swift (Set Data-Structure) Basics, With Practical Example : Pizza Cooking", "category" : "", "tags" : " Development, iOS, Programming, Swift, Data-Structures, Math", "url" : "/blog/swift-set-data-structure-with-practical-example-pizza-cooking", "date" : "March 8, 2022", "excerpt" : "Swift provides three main collection types, Arrays, Sets, and Dictionaries..

Unlike logical operators like &quot;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&quot; and ||, which operate on entire values, bitwise operators perform operations on individual bits within a value. This post explores the different bitwise operators available in Swift, their theoretical underpinnings, and practical examples to demonstrate their utility in real-world scenarios. Overview of Bitwise OperatorsBitwise operators are crucial in low-level programming tasks such as manipulating flags, performing graphics operations, networking, and encryption. Here’s a summary of the primary bitwise operators in Swift: Operator Description &amp;amp; Binary AND \\| Binary OR ^ Binary XOR ~ Binary One’s Complement &amp;lt;&amp;lt; Binary Shift Left &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Binary Shift Right Truth Table for XORThe XOR (exclusive OR) operator is particularly interesting. It compares corresponding bits of two operands and returns 1 if the bits are different, and 0 if they are the same. Here’s the truth table for XOR: A B A ^ B TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE Bitwise Operations in SwiftLet’s start by exploring how to represent integers as binary strings in Swift, and then apply various bitwise operators to them:extension Int { var binaryDescription: String { var binaryString = &quot;&quot; var internalNumber = self for _ in (1...self.bitWidth) { binaryString.insert(contentsOf: &quot;\\(internalNumber &amp;amp; 1)&quot;, at: binaryString.startIndex) internalNumber &amp;gt;&amp;gt;= 1 } return &quot;0b &quot; + binaryString }}func bitwiseExample() { let x1 = 0x1 let x2 = 0x2 print(&quot;x1\t&quot;, x1.binaryDescription ) print(&quot;x2\t&quot;, x2.binaryDescription ) let binaryAnd = (x1 &amp;amp; x2) let binaryOr = (x1 | x2) let binaryXor = (x1 ^ x2) let binaryComplement = (~x1) let binaryShiftL = (x1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1) let binaryShiftR = (x1 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1) print(&quot;&amp;amp;\t&quot;, binaryAnd.binaryDescription ) print(&quot;|\t&quot;, binaryOr.binaryDescription ) print(&quot;^\t&quot;, binaryXor.binaryDescription ) print(&quot;~\t&quot;, binaryComplement.binaryDescription ) print(&quot;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;\t&quot;, binaryShiftL.binaryDescription ) print(&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;\t&quot;, binaryShiftR.binaryDescription )}When executed, this code will output:x1 0b 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001x2 0b 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010&amp;amp; 0b 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000| 0b 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011^ 0b 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011~ 0b 1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111110&amp;lt;&amp;lt; 0b 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 0b 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000Practical Applications of Bitwise OperatorsBitwise operators are not just theoretical—they have practical uses in many areas of programming. Here are some real-world examples:1. Color Format ConversionA common use case for bitwise operators is converting a HEX color value into its RGB components in iOS development:extension UIColor { convenience init(red: Int, green: Int, blue: Int) { assert(red &amp;gt;= 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; red &amp;lt;= 255, &quot;Invalid red component&quot;) assert(green &amp;gt;= 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; green &amp;lt;= 255, &quot;Invalid green component&quot;) assert(blue &amp;gt;= 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; blue &amp;lt;= 255, &quot;Invalid blue component&quot;) self.init(red: CGFloat(red) / 255.0, green: CGFloat(green) / 255.0, blue: CGFloat(blue) / 255.0, alpha: 1.0) } convenience init(rgb: Int) { self.init( red: (rgb &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 16) &amp;amp; 0xFF, green: (rgb &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 8) &amp;amp; 0xFF, blue: rgb &amp;amp; 0xFF ) }}2. Quick &amp;amp; Dirty HashingBitwise operations can also be used to create simple hash functions. The chaoticHash function computes a chaotic hash value for a given string by mixing the ASCII values of its characters using bitwise operations and arithmetic. It starts with a prime constant to enhance distribution and applies multiple transformations to ensure that small changes in the input result in significantly different hash outputs.func chaoticHash(input: String) -&amp;gt; Int { var hashValue = 31 // Starting with a prime constant for better distribution for character in input { let asciiValue = Int(character.asciiValue ?? 0) hashValue ^= (asciiValue * 31) hashValue = (hashValue &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 5) | (hashValue &amp;gt;&amp;gt; (32 - 5)) hashValue += asciiValue hashValue ^= (hashValue &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 13) } return hashValue}let inputString = &quot;SwiftByDeya&quot;let hashValue = chaoticHash(input: inputString)print(&quot;Chaotic Hash Value: \\(hashValue)&quot;)// Outputs the computed chaotic hash value 3637872018676935840 Note: This hash function is not secure and should not be used in production environments.3. Base64 EncodingBase64 encoding involves converting a series of 8-bit bytes into 6-bit character lookup indexes. Bitwise operators like SHIFT, AND, OR, and NOT are crucial in performing these operations efficiently.4. Checking if a Number is Odd/EvenYou can quickly check if a number is odd or even using the following bitwise operations:func isEven(number: Int) -&amp;gt; Bool { return (number &amp;amp; 0x1) == 0}func isOdd(number: Int) -&amp;gt; Bool { return (number &amp;amp; 0x1) &amp;gt; 0}5. Efficiently Swapping Two VariablesBitwise XOR can be used to swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable:var a = 5var b = 10a = a ^ bb = a ^ ba = a ^ b6. Network Address CalculationsBitwise operations are vital in calculating valid network addresses, subnet masks, and broadcast addresses in networking.7. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)In role-based access control systems, bitwise operations are often used to calculate and manage permissions efficiently.8. Fast Inverse Square RootA famous example of bitwise operations is the fast inverse square root, used in graphics programming. The original implementation can be found here.ConclusionBitwise operators are a versatile tool in a Swift programmer’s toolkit. From manipulating individual bits to optimizing performance in specific tasks, understanding and leveraging bitwise operators can help you write more efficient and powerful code." }, { "title" : "Easily Tiling Images in Interface Builder Without Code", "category" : "", "tags" : " Development, iOS, Programming, Swift, Interface-Builder, Xcode", "url" : "/blog/easily-tiling-images-in-interface-builder-without-code", "date" : "February 23, 2022", "excerpt" : "Tiling images directly within Interface Builder, without writing code, can save time and simplify your UI design process.

This post will guide you through the steps and provide additional tips to enhance your image tiling experience. Why Tile Images?Tiling images is a technique used to create repeating patterns or backgrounds in your app’s user interface. It’s particularly useful for creating seamless backgrounds or filling areas with a pattern that can expand or contract based on the device’s screen size. Step-by-Step Guide to Tiling Images1. Add an Image to Your Asset CatalogStart by adding the image you want to tile to your asset catalog in Xcode. Ensure the image is appropriately sized for tiling, meaning it should be able to repeat seamlessly.2. Enable Slicing in Interface BuilderOnce your image is in the asset catalog: Select the image asset. Go to the “Editor” menu. Choose “Show Slicing.”The image will now appear with a darker overlay and a “Start Slicing” button. This mode allows you to specify how the image should be sliced for tiling.3. Configure Slicing for TilingClick “Start Slicing” and select the appropriate slicing type. The slicing tool allows you to define insets for the image, which determine how the image is stretched or tiled. Edge Insets: Define the margins around the image that should remain unstretched. The central part of the image will be tiled. Center Mode: The center part of the image can be repeated or stretched depending on your configuration.In most cases, you’ll want the Left, Right, Top, and Bottom insets to be zero, and the Width and Height to match the image dimensions. This setup ensures the image tiles seamlessly. Slicing Interface 4. Adjust Content Mode for Proper TilingTo ensure your image tiles correctly, set the image view’s content mode to Fill rather than Fit. The Fill mode repeats the image to fill the available space, whereas Fit scales the image to fit within the space, which may not give the desired tiling effect. Tiling Configuration Tips for Effective Tiling Use Seamless Patterns: Ensure your images are designed to tile seamlessly without visible edges or breaks. Experiment with Insets: Play around with different slicing insets to achieve creative tiling effects, such as borders or padding. Optimize Image Size: Large images can increase your app’s memory usage, so consider optimizing your images for size without sacrificing quality.Go Wild with Your ImaginationTiling offers endless possibilities for creativity in your app design. By experimenting with different images and configurations, you can create visually stunning interfaces. Below is an example of a simple pattern tiled across a view: Example of Tiled Images in Interface Builder ConclusionTiling images in Interface Builder without code is a powerful technique that can simplify your design process and enhance your app’s visual appeal. With the right tools and a bit of creativity, you can create dynamic, scalable backgrounds and patterns that elevate your user interface to the next level." }, { "title" : "Why my 0.3 MB image occupies around 10 MB on RAM?", "category" : "", "tags" : " Development, iOS, Programming, Swift, Performance, Graphics, Optimization", "url" : "/blog/why-my-0-3-mb-image-takes-14-mb-on-ram", "date" : "February 22, 2022", "excerpt" : "When developing applications, especially those that handle a large number of images, you may notice a significant difference between the disk size of an image and the amount of RAM it consumes.

For example, you might have an image file that is only 0.3 MB on disk, yet it occupies around 10 MB of RAM when loaded. This post explores why this happens and what you can do to manage memory usage more effectively. Why Is There a Discrepancy?The primary reason for this discrepancy lies in how images are stored on disk versus how they are represented in memory. Images on disk are often compressed using formats like JPEG or PNG, which reduce file size by storing data more efficiently. However, when an image is loaded into RAM, it must be decompressed and converted into a raw bitmap format that the system can render on the screen. This raw format requires significantly more memory.The Formula for Memory UsageTo understand how much memory an image will consume, you can use the following formula:\\[\\scriptsize{\\text{Image Size on RAM} = (\\text{pixels height} \\times \\text{pixels width} \\times \\text{color depth bytes})}\\]Example: sRGB ImageConsider an image with dimensions 1568x960 pixels and an sRGB color profile, which uses 24 bits per pixel (or 3 bytes per pixel):The following image takes around 131 KB on disk and has an sRGB color profile, which is 24 bits (8 bits per channel). The size of the image on the RAM would be:\\[\\scriptsize{\\text{Image Size on RAM} = (\\text{1568} \\times \\text{960} \\times \\text{3}) \\text{ bytes} = 4,515,840 \\text{ bytes} = 4.3 MB}\\]Managing Image Memory UsageHigh memory usage from images can lead to performance issues, especially in memory-constrained environments like mobile devices. To mitigate this, you can employ several strategies:Downsampling ImagesOne effective way to reduce memory usage is to downsample images before loading them into memory. Downsampling reduces the image dimensions to match the display size, thus reducing the number of pixels and the overall memory required.Example in Swift with KingfisherIn Swift, Kingfisher comes with an option to downsize images according to the screen scale, so you can have images in a reasonable size even if they come largely from the server.import UIKitimport Kingfisherextension UIImageView { func setImageAsThumb(url:String) { let formattedURL = url.addingPercentEncoding(withAllowedCharacters: .urlQueryAllowed) ?? &quot;&quot; let scale = UIScreen.main.scale let resizingProcessor = ResizingImageProcessor(referenceSize: CGSize(width: 50.0 * scale, height: 50.0 * scale)) self.kf.setImage(with: URL(string: formattedURL), placeholder: nil, options: [.processor(resizingProcessor)]) }} As the two images in this post are the same size and color profile, they will occupy the same amount of RAM!Understanding Image Compression FormatsWhile JPEG and PNG are common image formats, they handle compression differently: JPEG: Lossy compression, which reduces file size by discarding some image data. It’s efficient for photos but less so for images with sharp edges or text. PNG: Lossless compression, which retains all image data. It’s better for images that need to preserve exact details but usually results in larger file sizes than JPEG.Both formats, when decompressed, will expand into a full bitmap that occupies significantly more memory.ConclusionUnderstanding how images are represented in memory versus on disk is crucial for optimizing your applications. While a compressed image file might be small, its memory footprint can be substantial due to the need to store it as a raw bitmap in RAM. By employing strategies like downsampling, you can better manage memory usage and improve your application’s performance." }, { "title" : "Why You Should Never Use Floating-Point or Double Data Types for Money Calculations!", "category" : "", "tags" : " Development, iOS, Programming, Swift", "url" : "/blog/never-use-floating-point-double-data-types-for-monetary-calculations", "date" : "February 12, 2022", "excerpt" : "Handling money in software is a task that requires precision, especially when dealing with fractions of currency like dollars and cents.

One common mistake that developers make is using floating-point data types, such as Double, to represent monetary values. This post explains why this is problematic and what alternatives you should use. Avoid Floating-Point for Monetary Values The Problem with Floating-Point ArithmeticFloating-point values, including the Double type in Swift, should be avoided when working with currency amounts that have fractions. The fundamental issue is that floating-point types cannot represent certain decimal values exactly due to their binary nature.Example Showing Unexpected ResultsConsider the following example where you want to store 0.1 dollars:var balance: Double = 0.0for _ in 1...10{ balance += 0.1}for _ in 1...10{ balance -= 0.1}print(balance) // Outputs: 2.7755575615628914e-17Here, the expected value is 0.0 but we get 2.7755575615628914e-17 since value 0.1 is not stored precisely as 0.1 but as an approximation (e.g., 0.10000000149…). This small difference can have significant consequences, especially when performing multiple arithmetic operations.Loss of SignificanceWhen performing a series of arithmetic operations using floating-point numbers, you may encounter a problem known as loss of significance. This occurs when the precision errors from approximations accumulate, leading to larger errors that can affect the outcome of your calculations.Let’s consider a scenario where you repeatedly add 0.1 dollars to an account balance:var balance: Double = 0.0for _ in 1...100 { balance += 0.1}print(balance) // Outputs: 9.9999999999999999Instead of getting the expected 10.0, the result is slightly off due to accumulated floating-point errors. This can be particularly troublesome in financial applications where accuracy is critical.The Correct Approach: Use Decimal or NSDecimalNumberTo avoid the pitfalls of floating-point arithmetic, you should use the Decimal type in Swift, which is designed for precise decimal arithmetic. The Decimal type can represent numbers exactly as they appear, making it suitable for financial calculations.Example: Using DecimalHere’s how you can correctly handle monetary values using Decimal:let myBalance: Decimal = 12.333let result = myBalance / 3print(result) // Outputs: 4.111In this example, the division operation yields the expected result with no loss of precision.Converting Double to DecimalIf you need to work with a value initially stored as a Double, you can convert it to a Decimal using NSNumber:let doubleValue: Double = 12.333let decimalValue: Decimal = NSNumber(floatLiteral: doubleValue).decimalValuelet result = decimalValue / 3print(result) // Outputs: 4.111By converting to Decimal, you can ensure that your calculations are accurate and free from the issues associated with floating-point arithmetic.ConclusionWhen it comes to monetary calculations, accuracy is paramount. The floating-point types, including Double, should be avoided due to their inherent imprecision. Instead, use Decimal or NSDecimalNumber to ensure that your financial calculations are accurate and reliable. This small change can save you from potential bugs and errors in your applications, especially those dealing with money." }, { "title" : "Swift: The Difference Between Void and ()", "category" : "", "tags" : " Development, iOS, Programming, Swift", "url" : "/blog/swift-void-and", "date" : "November 29, 2021", "excerpt" : "Void is a concept familiar across many programming languages.

In Swift, Void has a unique and specific meaning, rooted in the language’s type system.This post explores the intricacies of Void in Swift, how it relates to the empty tuple (), and how it is used in functions, methods, and closures. What is Void in Swift?In Swift’s standard library, Void is simply a typealias for an empty tuple (). This is important because Swift, unlike many other languages, treats Void as a type, which is crucial in a language that emphasizes type safety.public typealias Void = ()The above definition means that Void is nothing more than a convenient way to refer to an empty tuple. When a function doesn’t return any value, Swift allows you to specify the return type as Void. However, if you omit the return type, Swift implicitly assumes the function returns Void.Void and Type SafetyIn Swift, type safety is a core principle. The concept of Void as an empty tuple fits neatly into this system, ensuring that functions, methods, and closures that don’t return a value still conform to Swift’s type system.Consider the following function:func doSomething() -&amp;gt; Void { print(&quot;Doing something&quot;)}This is functionally equivalent to:func doSomething() { print(&quot;Doing something&quot;)}In both cases, doSomething returns Void, but the explicit version makes it clear that no value is expected from the function.The Empty Tuple ()In Swift, () can represent both a type and a value. As a type: () is the empty tuple type, which is equivalent to Void. As a value: () is an empty tuple, which is equivalent to Void().This dual role can sometimes cause confusion, especially for developers coming from other programming languages where Void is a keyword rather than a type.Practical Uses of VoidUnderstanding Void as a type opens up some practical applications in Swift, particularly in generic programming and higher-order functions.Example: Using Void in a Closurelet completionHandler: () -&amp;gt; Void = { print(&quot;Task completed&quot;)}completionHandler()Here, the closure completionHandler takes no parameters and returns Void. This pattern is common in asynchronous programming, where closures often signal the completion of a task.Void and () in Swift Optional Void: You can have an Optional&amp;lt;Void&amp;gt; in Swift, which can be useful when you want to represent the presence or absence of a side-effect without returning an actual value.var action: (() -&amp;gt; Void)?action = { print(&quot;Action performed!&quot;)}// Executing the action if it existsaction?() Higher-Order Functions: Void can be used in higher-order functions where you need to define a function that takes a function as a parameter and returns Void. func executeTask(task: () -&amp;gt; Void) { task()} executeTask { print(&quot;Executing task&quot;)} Void is Not the Same as voidIn languages like C, C++, and Objective-C, void is a keyword that indicates a function doesn’t return a value. In Swift, Void is a type, which means you can do things with Void that you couldn’t do with void in other languages, such as using Void in type constraints or as a generic parameter.This function works with any type and explicitly states that it returns Void.SummaryIn Swift, Void is more than just a synonym for “no return value”; it is a type that integrates smoothly with Swift’s emphasis on type safety and flexibility. Understanding Void as an empty tuple () provides deeper insights into how Swift handles functions, closures, and type constraints.By leveraging Void, you can write more expressive, safer, and more flexible Swift code, whether you’re working on simple functions or complex generic algorithms. Keep in mind: Void is not just an absence of a return type—it’s an integral part of Swift’s type system that enables type-safe, expressive code." }, { "title" : "Swift: The Difference Between nil, Nil, NULL, NSNull", "category" : "", "tags" : " Development, iOS, Programming, Swift, Objective-C", "url" : "/blog/swift-the-difference-between-nil-nil-null-nsnull", "date" : "November 27, 2021", "excerpt" : "As a programmer, you will often need to represent the concept of “nothingness.” In Swift and Objective-C, this idea manifests in various forms: nil, Nil, NULL, and NSNull.

Each of these serves a distinct purpose and is used in different contexts. Understanding these concepts is fundamental to mastering memory management, type safety, and interoperability between Swift and Objective-C. Understanding the KeywordsWhen dealing with programming languages like Swift and Objective-C, it’s crucial to grasp how they handle the concept of “nothing.” This “nothing” can be expressed in different ways: nil, Nil, NULL, and NSNull. These terms, while similar in appearance, have distinct meanings and uses.The Concept of “Null” in ProgrammingIn many programming languages, including C, Objective-C, and Swift, “null” represents the absence of a value or a reference to an object that doesn’t exist. This is a crucial concept because it allows programs to handle cases where data is missing, uninitialized, or optional. However, how “null” is implemented and used can vary between languages and contexts.NULLNULL is a macro in C and Objective-C, typically defined as ((void*)0). It represents a null pointer, which is a pointer that doesn’t point to any memory location. In C-based languages, it’s common to use NULL to indicate that a pointer is not currently pointing to any valid object or memory address. In Objective-C, NULL is often used for pointers to non-object types, such as structures or primitive data types.In practice, NULL is crucial for error handling and conditional logic, allowing developers to check whether a pointer is valid before attempting to use it. For example:int *ptr = NULL;if (ptr == NULL) { // Handle the case where ptr is not pointing to anything}nilIn Objective-C, nil is used to represent a null pointer to an object. It is essentially a way to say “this object does not exist.” Defined as #define nil NULL, it is functionally equivalent to NULL but is specifically intended for use with Objective-C objects. When a message is sent to nil, nothing happens; it returns a value of 0 or nil, depending on the expected return type. This behavior simplifies error handling in Objective-C, as it avoids crashes that would occur if you attempted to send a message to an uninitialized object.Here’s an example:NSString *string = nil;if (!string) { // The string is nil, handle accordingly}NilNil is similar to nil, but it is used specifically for class pointers in Objective-C. When a class variable is Nil, it indicates that the class does not exist. This distinction is important because Objective-C differentiates between instances of classes (objects) and the classes themselves. For instance, Nil might be used when checking if a class has been defined or loaded into memory.NSNullNSNull is an Objective-C class that provides a way to represent null values in collection objects such as NSArray, NSDictionary, and NSSet. These collections do not allow nil values because nil is used to signify the absence of an object. Instead, [NSNull null] acts as a placeholder for nil in these cases.For example, if you want to store a null value in an array:NSArray *array = @[[NSNull null]];In this array, the first (and only) element is [NSNull null], representing a null value.Swift and Objective-C InteroperabilitySwift, being a more modern language, handles “nothingness” differently. In Swift, nil is not a pointer but rather the absence of a value of a certain type. This difference is crucial when working with Swift and Objective-C together, particularly in projects where both languages are used.Example: Interacting with Objective-C Code in SwiftConsider the following Objective-C code:// Machine.h#import &amp;lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&amp;gt;@interface Machine : NSObject@property (strong, nonatomic) id serialNumber;- (void) summary;@end// Machine.m#import &amp;lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&amp;gt;#import &quot;Machine.h&quot;@implementation Machine- (void) summary { NSLog(@&quot;Initializing Machine&quot;); NSString *label1 = @&quot;label1&quot;; NSString *label2 = nil; NSString *label3 = [NSNull null]; NSString *label4 = Nil; NSString *label5 = NULL; NSLog(@&quot;Label1 = %@&quot;,label1); NSLog(@&quot;Label2 = %@&quot;,label2); NSLog(@&quot;Label3 = %@&quot;,label3); NSLog(@&quot;Label4 = %@&quot;,label4); NSLog(@&quot;Label5 = %@&quot;,label5);}@endIn Swift, you can interact with this Objective-C code as follows:let OC_Machine = Machine()OC_Machine.summary()OC_Machine.serialNumber = 21OC_Machine.serialNumber = nilOC_Machine.serialNumber = NSNull()//OC_Machine.serialNumber = Nil//OC_Machine.serialNumber = NULLprint(OC_Machine.serialNumber)The commented lines will not compile in Swift because Swift does not support the use of Nil and NULL in the same way Objective-C does. The output of the above code will be:Label1 = label1 Label2 = (null) Label3 = &amp;lt;null&amp;gt; Label4 = (null) Label5 = (null) Optional(&amp;lt;null&amp;gt;) This example highlights the importance of understanding how each language treats “nothingness” and how these concepts map between Objective-C and Swift.Summary of Key Points NULL is used for non-object pointers in C and Objective-C. It represents a null pointer in a generic sense, applicable to various data types. nil is used for object pointers in Objective-C, specifically indicating that an object does not exist. Nil is used for class pointers in Objective-C, representing the absence of a class. NSNull is a singleton object used to represent null values in collections where nil is not allowed.In Swift, nil is a fundamental part of the language’s type system and is used to indicate the absence of a value. Unlike Objective-C, where nil is a pointer, Swift’s nil is not. Understanding these differences is essential for developers working with both languages, especially in projects that involve interoperability between Swift and Objective-C. In Objective-C, nil is a pointer to a non-existent object. In Swift, nil is the absence of a value. NULL and nil are equal to each other in Objective-C, but nil is used specifically for object pointers, while NULL is for generic pointers. [NSNull null] is an object meant to represent nil in contexts where nil is not allowed, such as in collections.By mastering these concepts, you’ll be better equipped to handle memory management and interoperability challenges in both Objective-C and Swift." }, { "title" : "Understanding Swift: Differences Between Any, AnyObject, and AnyHashable", "category" : "", "tags" : " Development, iOS, Programming, Swift, Objective-C", "url" : "/blog/swift-any-anyobject", "date" : "November 26, 2021", "excerpt" : "When working with Swift, one of the key decisions you’ll often face is how to represent data types.

While specificity in defining data types is generally encouraged, Swift offers three flexible type options: Any, AnyObject, and AnyHashable. Exploring Swift&#39;s Flexible Type System Understanding when and how to use these types is crucial for developing robust and interoperable Swift applications.Introduction to Any, AnyObject, and AnyHashableSwift is a strongly typed language, meaning that every variable, constant, or expression must have a clearly defined type. However, there are situations where the exact type might not be known until runtime, or where flexibility in type is required. This is where Any, AnyObject, and AnyHashable come into play.AnyThe Any type represents an instance of any type at all, including function types, class instances, structs, and enums. It’s the most general type in Swift, allowing you to work with values without needing to know their specific types in advance.let mixedArray: [Any] = [1, &quot;Hello&quot;, 3.14, [1, 2, 3]]In this example, mixedArray can store any combination of types, from integers to strings and arrays. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where type flexibility is essential, but it should be used sparingly due to the loss of type safety.Real-World Use Cases for Any in Swift Handling Mixed-Type Data Collections Use Any to create an array that holds various data types, which is useful for data parsing from APIs. var things: [Any] = [] things.append(0) // Int things.append(3.14) // Double things.append(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) // String things.append((3.0, 5.0)) // Tuple Dynamic Function HandlingStore function types in a collection, allowing for dynamic function calls.let functions: [Any] = [ { (name: String) -&amp;gt; String in &quot;Hello, $$name)&quot; }, { (x: Int) -&amp;gt; Int in x * 2 }]or this detailed Exampleprotocol AnyFunction { func call(with input: Any) -&amp;gt; Any}let functions: [AnyFunction] = [ AnyFunctionWrapper { (name: String) -&amp;gt; String in &quot;Hello, \\(name)&quot; }, AnyFunctionWrapper { (x: Int) -&amp;gt; Int in x * 2 }]struct AnyFunctionWrapper: AnyFunction { private let _call: (Any) -&amp;gt; Any init&amp;lt;T, R&amp;gt;(_ function: @escaping (T) -&amp;gt; R) { _call = { input in if let typedInput = input as? T { return function(typedInput) } return &quot;Invalid input type&quot; } } func call(with input: Any) -&amp;gt; Any { return _call(input) }}let greetingResult = functions[0].call(with: &quot;Alice&quot;)print(greetingResult) // Output: Hello, Alicelet doublingResult = functions[1].call(with: 5)print(doublingResult) // Output: 10let invalidResult = functions[0].call(with: 42)print(invalidResult) // Output: Invalid input type Interfacing with Objective-C APIsUse Any to handle untyped objects returned by Objective-C methods, facilitating seamless interaction. Generic ProgrammingAccept or return any type in generic programming, simplifying function signatures when specific types are not essential. Temporary Data StructuresBuild temporary data structures for algorithms, allowing storage of various types without creating multiple collections. Caution in Usage: While Any offers flexibility, it can lead to loss of type safety and increased complexity. Use more specific types whenever possible to maintain clarity and safety in your codebase.AnyObjectAnyObject is a protocol that all class types implicitly conform to. It’s used when you need to work specifically with instances of classes rather than value types like structs or enums. AnyObject is commonly used in scenarios where Swift interacts with Objective-C, especially because Objective-C types are generally class-based.let objectArray: [AnyObject] = [NSString(string: &quot;Hello&quot;), NSNumber(value: 42)]Here, objectArray holds instances that are guaranteed to be class types. This makes AnyObject a safer option when you’re dealing with class instances, especially in mixed-language projects involving both Swift and Objective-C.Real-World Use Cases for AnyObject in SwiftAnyObject allows you to work with instances of any class type. Here are some real-world scenarios where it can be beneficial: Interacting with Objective-C APIs Use AnyObject to handle untyped objects from Objective-C methods and properties, facilitating seamless interaction with these APIs. Parsing Mixed-Type JSON Data Store parsed JSON data containing a mix of types (strings, numbers, booleans) in a flexible way using AnyObject. Creating Heterogeneous Collections Create arrays or dictionaries that hold instances of different class types, allowing for storage of diverse objects together. Bridging Objective-C Classes to Swift Use AnyObject for properties, method parameters, and return values when bridging Objective-C classes, enabling interaction without knowing specific types. Implementing Dynamic Behavior Leverage AnyObject to call any Objective-C method, creating flexible and extensible APIs. Note: While AnyObject is useful, it’s important to prioritize type safety and performance by using more specific types whenever possible.AnyHashableAnyHashable is a type in Swift that allows you to store values of different types that conform to the Hashable protocol in a single collection. This is particularly useful when you need a heterogeneous collection of hashable types, such as when using a dictionary or a set.Key Features Type Erasure: AnyHashable provides a way to erase the specific type of a hashable value while still maintaining its hashability. Interoperability: It can be used in collections like Set or Dictionary where the key types might differ.Example UsageHere’s a simple example demonstrating how to use AnyHashable:let intKey: AnyHashable = AnyHashable(42)let stringKey: AnyHashable = AnyHashable(&quot;Hello&quot;)let dictionary: [AnyHashable: String] = [ intKey: &quot;This is an integer key&quot;, stringKey: &quot;This is a string key&quot;]for (key, value) in dictionary { print(&quot;\\(key): \\(value)&quot;)}The Difference Between Any and AnyObject in SwiftAny and AnyObject are two special types in Swift used for type erasure, allowing you to work with values of unknown or mixed types. Here are the key differences:Any Represents any type, including value types (structs, enums) and reference types (classes). Can be used to store heterogeneous collections of values. Example usage: let mixedArray: [Any] = [1, &quot;Hello&quot;, true, 2.0]for item in mixedArray { switch item { case let x as Int: print(&quot;Int: \\(x)&quot;) case let x as String: print(&quot;String: \\(x)&quot;) case let x as Bool: print(&quot;Bool: \\(x)&quot;) case let x as Double: print(&quot;Double: \\(x)&quot;) default: print(&quot;Unknown type&quot;) }} AnyObjectRepresents any instance of a class, equivalent to id in Objective-C.Only allows reference types (classes) and is useful when you specifically want to work with class instances.Example usage:class Car {}class Song {}let objectsArray: [AnyObject] = [Car(), Car(), Song()]for item in objectsArray { if let car = item as? Car { print(&quot;Car: $$car)&quot;) } else if let song = item as? Song { print(&quot;Song: $$song)&quot;) } else { print(&quot;Unknown type&quot;) }}When to Use Any vs. AnyObject Use Any: When your collection or variable needs to handle multiple types, including value types like Int, String, and Array. When your data will be used exclusively in Swift code, allowing you to include both value and reference types. Use AnyObject: When dealing with APIs that expect class types, such as when interfacing with Objective-C code. When you specifically need to work with reference types. When your data will interact with Objective-C code or when you specifically need to constrain your data to class types. AnyHashableAs mentioned earlier, AnyHashable is a type-erased wrapper that can hold any value conforming to the Hashable protocol. It allows you to store heterogeneously-typed values in collections that require a hashable type, such as sets or dictionaries.import Foundationlet anyHashableDict: [AnyHashable: Any] = [ &quot;key1&quot;: &quot;value1&quot;, 42: &quot;value2&quot;, UUID(): &quot;value3&quot;]print(anyHashableDict)In this example, anyHashableDict can have keys of different types, as long as those types conform to the Hashable protocol. AnyHashable is particularly useful when dealing with untyped sets or dictionaries coming from Objective-C, as it provides the necessary flexibility while maintaining type safety within Swift.ConclusionUnderstanding when to use Any, AnyObject, and AnyHashable can greatly enhance your flexibility and interoperability in Swift development. While these types provide powerful tools for working with a wide range of data, it’s important to use them judiciously to maintain the clarity and safety of your code. By carefully choosing the appropriate type based on the needs of your application, you can ensure that your Swift code is both robust and adaptable." }, { "title" : "Swift Root/Base Class &amp; NSObject: A Quick Look", "category" : "", "tags" : " Development, iOS, Programming, Swift", "url" : "/blog/swift-root-class-nsobject", "date" : "November 16, 2021", "excerpt" : "In the world of object-oriented programming (OOP), the concept of a root or base class is foundational for understanding class inheritance and the relationships between different classes.Whether you’re building an app in Swift or working with lega...", "content" : "In the world of object-oriented programming (OOP), the concept of a root or base class is foundational for understanding class inheritance and the relationships between different classes.Whether you’re building an app in Swift or working with legacy Objective-C code, grasping the role of the root class is key to designing robust, scalable software. In this post, we’ll dive deep into the role of the root class in Swift and its relationship with NSObject within the context of Objective-C and Cocoa frameworks. Understanding the Concept of a Root ClassIn object-oriented programming, a root class, also known as a base class, is the topmost class in an inheritance hierarchy. It acts as the foundation upon which all other classes are built. Essentially, all subclasses inherit the properties and methods of the root class, making it a critical element in the design of any object-oriented system.Key Characteristics of a Root Class: Inheritance: A root class provides default implementations for properties and methods that can be inherited and potentially overridden by subclasses. Polymorphism: The root class enables polymorphic behavior, allowing subclasses to be treated as instances of the root class, enabling flexible and reusable code. Common Interface: It often defines a common interface that all subclasses adhere to, ensuring consistency across the object hierarchy.Root Class in Objective-C and CocoaIn Objective-C, the de facto root class for nearly all objects within the Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks is NSObject, a part of the Foundation framework. This means that virtually every class in these frameworks ultimately derives from NSObject, either directly or indirectly.NSObject in DetailNSObject is more than just a root class; it’s the cornerstone of the entire Cocoa framework. It provides a wealth of essential methods that support basic object behavior, including: Memory Management: With methods like retain, release, and autorelease, NSObject plays a pivotal role in manual memory management under the older retain/release model, and it’s still relevant in the context of ARC (Automatic Reference Counting). Method Swizzling: NSObject facilitates powerful runtime features like method swizzling, allowing developers to dynamically change method implementations at runtime. Equality and Hashing: NSObject defines fundamental methods such as isEqual: and hash, which are crucial for comparing objects and storing them in collections like NSSet or NSDictionary. KVC &amp;amp; KVO: It also supports Key-Value Coding (KVC) and Key-Value Observing (KVO), allowing properties to be accessed and monitored dynamically at runtime.Root Class in SwiftIn Swift, when you define a class without specifying a superclass, it automatically becomes a root class, reflecting a deliberate design choice aimed at simplicity and safety. This approach is similar to Objective-C, where although NSObject is commonly used as the root class, it is not strictly enforced. Developers can create classes that do not inherit from any other class, allowing for custom root classes. For instance, Apple’s API includes multiple root classes, such as NSObject, NSProxy, and the now-deprecated Object.The historical reason for having a root class, particularly in Objective-C, was to ensure that all objects shared a common interface, including essential methods like isEqualTo:, hash(), and others required for collection classes. However, with the advent of generics in Swift, the necessity of a root class has diminished.In Swift, many of the methods traditionally provided by NSObject have been distributed across protocols such as Equatable, Hashable, and CustomStringConvertible, which allows both classes and structs to share common interfaces. This approach enhances Swift’s flexibility and aligns with its protocol-oriented nature.Although a universal root class is not necessary in pure Swift, you can still inherit from NSObject when working with Objective-C APIs, ensuring smooth interoperability. It’s also important to understand that Swift classes do not run on top of Objective-C; they are compiled by the same compiler, which allows for seamless interoperation between Swift and Objective-C when needed. This is why the @objc attribute is sometimes required to ensure consistency with Objective-C protocols and classes.Swift’s Flexibility and InteroperabilitySwift does not have a universal base class that all classes inherit from by default. However, it is still designed to interoperate seamlessly with Objective-C, allowing developers to leverage existing Cocoa frameworks. This interoperability is facilitated through: @objc Attribute: This attribute marks Swift classes, methods, and properties to be compatible with Objective-C, enabling them to be exposed to and used by Objective-C code. This ensures that Swift and Objective-C can coexist within the same project, allowing for mixed-language development. NSObject: While not required, Swift classes can inherit from NSObject to gain access to Objective-C runtime features. This is particularly useful when working with Cocoa APIs that rely on dynamic features such as KVO (Key-Value Observing) or when a class needs to be compatible with Objective-C’s expectations, such as when it needs to be part of an Objective-C collection or needs to respond to selectors.Practical ImplicationsWhen working within a mixed Swift/Objective-C codebase, understanding when and why to subclass NSObject is critical. For example: Interfacing with Cocoa Frameworks: If your Swift class needs to interact with Cocoa frameworks that rely on Objective-C runtime features, subclassing NSObject may be necessary. Using KVO: If you plan to use Key-Value Observing, your Swift class must inherit from NSObject because KVO is deeply tied to the Objective-C runtime.ConclusionUnderstanding the role of root classes is essential for developers working with object-oriented languages like Swift and Objective-C. In Objective-C, NSObject serves as a commonly used root class, providing a rich set of functionalities that underpin the Cocoa frameworks. However, Objective-C does not enforce a universal base class, allowing for the creation of custom root classes.In contrast, Swift does not have a universal base class, offering more flexibility. Swift classes can stand alone without inheriting from any superclass, or they can inherit from NSObject when interoperability with Objective-C is required.Mastering the nuances of root classes in both languages can lead to more effective, maintainable, and scalable code. Whether you’re building new applications in Swift or maintaining legacy Objective-C code, a deep understanding of these concepts will serve as a powerful tool in your development arsenal." }, { "title" : "Exploring Swift&#39;s Basic Data Types &amp; Type Inference", "category" : "", "tags" : " Development, iOS, Programming, Swift", "url" : "/blog/swift-built-in-data-types", "date" : "November 15, 2021", "excerpt" : "Swift offers a variety of built-in data types that cater to different kinds of data.

Understanding these types is essential for writing efficient and bug-free code. Swift’s Basic Data TypesBelow is an overview of the primary data types available in Swift: Type Description Character Represents a single 16-bit Unicode character, like &quot;a&quot; or &quot;/&quot;. String Represents a sequence of characters, used for textual data like &quot;Hello&quot;. Float A 32-bit floating-point number, useful for representing fractional values. Double A 64-bit floating-point number, offering double the precision of a Float. Bool Represents a Boolean value, which can be either true or false. Tuples Groups multiple values into a single compound value, e.g., (1, &quot;Hello&quot;). Int Represents a signed integer (whole number). On 32-bit platforms, it is Int32; on 64-bit platforms, it is Int64. UInt Represents an unsigned integer (whole number). On 32-bit platforms, it is UInt32; on 64-bit platforms, it is UInt64. Int8 A signed 8-bit integer, capable of storing values from -128 to 127. Int32 A signed 32-bit integer, common in many programming tasks. Int64 A signed 64-bit integer, offering a wider range of values. UInt8 An unsigned 8-bit integer, with a range of 0 to 255. UInt32 An unsigned 32-bit integer, often used in systems programming. UInt64 An unsigned 64-bit integer, useful for representing large positive integers. Device-Specific Integer SizesOn 32-bit devices, the Int type has the size of Int32, while on 64-bit devices, it has the size of Int64. The same principle applies to UInt, where its size depends on the architecture of the device.Type Inference in SwiftOne of Swift’s powerful features is type inference, which allows the compiler to automatically determine the type of a variable based on the value assigned to it. This can significantly reduce the amount of boilerplate code and make the code more readable.Example of Type InferenceConsider the following example, where the type of the variable level is inferred by Swift:var level = 12Here, Swift automatically infers that level is of type Int because 12 is an integer. The compiler’s ability to infer types simplifies the code, especially in cases where the type is obvious from the context.Explicit Type AnnotationWhile type inference is a valuable feature, there are scenarios where explicitly specifying the type is beneficial or even necessary. For instance, when dealing with complex data structures or when the inferred type may not be immediately clear to someone reading your code, explicit type annotations enhance readability and maintainability.var level: Int = 17In this case, even though the type could be inferred, declaring it explicitly as Int improves clarity, particularly in larger codebases where understanding the intent behind each variable is crucial.The Impact of Type Inference on PerformanceType inference in Swift, while primarily aimed at improving code readability and reducing boilerplate, also has implications for performance. The Swift compiler is designed to be highly efficient, and type inference plays a role in this efficiency. However, understanding when and how type inference affects performance can help developers make informed decisions in critical parts of their code.Compilation PerformanceOne area where type inference can impact performance is during the compilation process. When Swift infers types, the compiler has to analyze the code more extensively to deduce the correct types, which can slightly increase compilation times, especially in large codebases with complex type relationships. While this overhead is generally minimal, it can become noticeable in very large projects or in code that makes heavy use of generic types and protocols.Runtime PerformanceAt runtime, Swift’s type inference has little to no impact on the performance of the compiled code. The inferred types are determined at compile time, meaning that by the time your application is running, the types are already fixed and optimized by the compiler. This ensures that the performance of your application is consistent, regardless of whether types were inferred or explicitly declared.Best Practices for PerformanceTo optimize both compile-time and runtime performance, consider the following best practices: Explicit Type Annotations in Complex Expressions: In scenarios where complex expressions are used, explicitly annotating types can help the compiler optimize the code more effectively, reducing compilation time. Avoid Overuse of Type Inference in Critical Paths: In performance-critical code, such as in tight loops or algorithms, explicit types can sometimes lead to more predictable and optimized compiled code. Balance Readability and Performance: While type inference makes code more concise, always balance this with the need for clarity and performance. In complex or critical sections of your code, it might be beneficial to favor explicit type declarations.By being mindful of when and where to rely on type inference, you can write Swift code that is both efficient and maintainable, ensuring that your applications perform optimally without sacrificing code quality.Unsafe Types in SwiftIn addition to the safe and type-safe data types that Swift provides, there are also “unsafe” types that allow developers to work with memory directly. These types are primarily used in scenarios where performance is critical, or when interfacing with lower-level APIs, such as C libraries. While they offer greater flexibility and control, they come with increased risks, as they bypass Swift’s safety features.1. UnsafePointerUnsafePointer is a type that provides a pointer to a memory location. It allows you to read values from memory without the safety guarantees that Swift typically enforces. Here’s an example of how to use UnsafePointer:let numbers: [Int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]let pointer = UnsafePointer(numbers)print(pointer[0]) // Access the first element2. UnsafeMutablePointerUnsafeMutablePointer allows both reading and writing of values at a specific memory location. This is useful when you need to modify the contents of an array or a buffer directly:var mutableNumbers: [Int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]let mutablePointer = UnsafeMutablePointer(&amp;amp;mutableNumbers)mutablePointer[0] = 10 // Change the first element to 10print(mutableNumbers) // Output: [10, 2, 3, 4, 5]3. UnsafeRawPointerUnsafeRawPointer is a pointer that points to raw memory without any type information. This can be useful for low-level operations, such as when working with binary data or interfacing with C APIs:var mutableNumbers: [Int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]let mutablePointer = UnsafeMutablePointer(&amp;amp;mutableNumbers)let rawPointer = UnsafeRawPointer(mutablePointer)let intPointer = rawPointer.assumingMemoryBound(to: Int.self)print(intPointer[0]) // Access the first element as an IntCGFloat: A Special CaseA noteworthy data type in Swift is CGFloat, which is particularly relevant when dealing with graphical calculations in iOS and macOS applications. CGFloat can represent either a 32-bit or 64-bit floating-point number, depending on the device’s CPU architecture. This makes it a versatile choice for applications that require precise and scalable graphical calculations, such as in drawing operations or animations.Understanding Swift’s data types and effectively using type inference can lead to more concise, readable, and safer code.

In Swift, the distinction between variables and constants is both clear and essential, influencing how you write and optimize your code. This blog post explores the concepts of mutability in Swift, comparing them to Objective-C, and discussing the broader implications of mutability in programming. The Power of Mutability in Swift Swift Variables and Constants: The BasicsIn Swift, the way you store data hinges on two keywords: let for constants and var for variables. This distinction is not just syntactical but plays a critical role in ensuring the safety, performance, and clarity of your code.For example, consider a Customer class in Swift:class Customer { let id = 22034 let birthdate = &quot;11/11/2011&quot; var balance = 109.3}Constants cannot change after you run your app, they prevent accidental breakage of a value that should not change.In this example: id and birthdate are constants (let), meaning once they are set, they cannot be changed. balance is a variable (var), meaning it can be modified after its initial assignment.Why Use Constants?Constants in Swift are more than just a way to store unchangeable data. They offer several advantages: Safety: By marking a value as constant, you prevent accidental modifications, which can lead to bugs and unintended behavior in your program. Performance: Constants can be optimized by the compiler for better performance. Since their values don’t change, the compiler can make assumptions that lead to faster code execution.Mutability in Objective-C vs. SwiftSwift’s clear distinction between let and var is a marked improvement over Objective-C, where mutability is less explicit. In Objective-C, immutability is often enforced through class hierarchies (e.g., NSString vs. NSMutableString) rather than syntax. This can lead to confusion, as the mutability of an object isn’t always immediately apparent from its declaration.NSString *constName = @&quot;John&quot;;NSMutableString *mutableName = [NSMutableString stringWithString:@&quot;John&quot;];In the above Objective-C example: constName is a constant pointer to an immutable NSString object. mutableName is a pointer to a mutable NSMutableString object.Swift, by contrast, makes mutability explicit with let and var. This clarity reduces the cognitive load on the developer, making the code easier to read, understand, and maintain.The Broader Implications of MutabilityMutability is a key concept not just in Swift, but in programming in general. When designing systems, deciding whether an object should be mutable or immutable has far-reaching consequences: Concurrency: Immutable objects are naturally thread-safe, as their state cannot change after they are created. This makes them ideal for concurrent programming. Design Patterns: Many design patterns, such as the Builder pattern, rely on mutability during object construction and immutability afterward. Predictability: Immutable objects lead to more predictable and less error-prone code since their state cannot change unexpectedly.In Swift, leveraging constants wherever possible can lead to more robust and maintainable code. By defaulting to let and only using var when necessary, you reduce the potential for bugs and make your intentions clear to others reading your code.Conclusion:Understanding and utilizing Swift’s approach to variables and constants is crucial for writing clean, efficient, and reliable code. By explicitly defining mutability with let and var, Swift encourages best practices and helps you avoid common pitfalls that can occur in languages with less clear mutability rules.Whether you’re transitioning from Objective-C or just starting with Swift, embracing these concepts will elevate the quality of your code and make your applications more robust. Remember, in Swift, clarity is key—so let your constants be constants and your variables be variables, and your code will thank you for it." }, { "title" : "Mastering Swift Style Guides: Elevate Your Code to the Next Level", "category" : "", "tags" : " Development, Programming, Swift", "url" : "/blog/swift-style-guides", "date" : "November 10, 2021", "excerpt" : "Have you ever dived into an open-source project and marveled at the elegance and consistency of the codebase? 🧐 It’s no coincidence.Such codebases follow meticulously crafted style guides that turn good code into great code.

It often boils down to one crucial element: the presence—or absence—of a robust code style guide. Crafting Consistency with Swift Style Guides The Importance of Code Style GuidesIn the vibrant world of Swift programming, various style guides have emerged, each offering its own take on how to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code. Some of the most influential guides come from industry giants like Apple, Google, Ray Wenderlich, LinkedIn, and Airbnb.Each guide brings its own flavor, but they all share a common goal: to help developers write better code.Choosing the Right Guide for Your ProjectChoosing a code style guide isn’t just about personal preference; it’s about aligning the guide with the specific needs of your project. Whether you’re building a high-performance app or a user-friendly interface, the right style guide can make all the difference. Take the time to explore these guides—delve into the nuances of each, and you’ll find one that resonates with your development style and project goals.Why Consistency MattersBut why does it matter so much? As developers, we spend far more time reading code than writing it 😌. A well-maintained code style isn’t just a nicety—it’s an investment in the future of your project. Consistency in code styling makes it easier for you and your team to understand, maintain, and extend the codebase. Proper indentation, consistent naming conventions, and thoughtful spacing aren’t just cosmetic—they’re the foundation of maintainable software that stands the test of time.

Remember, some punctuation is reserved in Swift and cannot be used as custom operators: Punctuation Restrictions (, ) Cannot be used as custom operators {, } Cannot be used as custom operators [, ] Cannot be used as custom operators ., , Cannot be used as custom operators :, ; Cannot be used as custom operators = Cannot be used as custom operators @, # Cannot be used as custom operators &amp;amp; Cannot be used as a prefix operator -&amp;gt; Cannot be used as custom operators ` Cannot be used as custom operators ?, ! Cannot be used as postfix operators Swift WhitespaceWhitespace in Swift plays a crucial role in improving code readability and structure. It is primarily used to separate tokens, ensuring that the syntax is clear and unambiguous. While whitespace can be freely used to format your code for better legibility, it is generally ignored by the Swift compiler unless it serves a syntactic purpose, such as distinguishing between prefixes or separating keywords and identifiers.Swift CommentsComments in Swift are essential for making your code more understandable to others (and yourself in the future). They are completely ignored by the compiler and serve purely for documentation purposes. Swift supports both single-line and multi-line comments, allowing you to annotate your code as needed:// This is a single line comment/* Multi line (block) comment - can havemore than one line! */" }, { "title" : "Swift Reserved Keywords, with brief explanations.", "category" : "", "tags" : " Development, Programming, Swift", "url" : "/blog/swift-keywords", "date" : "November 1, 2021", "excerpt" : "A reserved word is a term designated by the programming language that cannot be used as an identifier.

Operator Description &amp;amp; (Bitwise AND): Performs a bitwise AND operation between two integers. Each bit in the result is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of both operands are 1. | (Bitwise OR): Performs a bitwise OR operation between two integers. Each bit in the result is set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits of either operand is 1. ^ (Bitwise XOR): Performs a bitwise XOR operation between two integers. Each bit in the result is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of the operands are different. ~ (Bitwise NOT): Performs a bitwise NOT operation on a single integer. This operator inverts all the bits of the operand, turning 0s into 1s and 1s into 0s. &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (Left Shift): Shifts the bits of an integer to the left by a specified number of positions. This operation effectively multiplies the integer by 2 for each position shifted. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; (Right Shift): Shifts the bits of an integer to the right by a specified number of positions. This operation effectively divides the integer by 2 for each position shifted. &amp;amp;= (Bitwise AND Assignment): Combines the bitwise AND operation with assignment. It updates the variable by performing a bitwise AND between its current value and another value. |= (Bitwise OR Assignment): Combines the bitwise OR operation with assignment. It updates the variable by performing a bitwise OR between its current value and another value. ^= (Bitwise XOR Assignment): Combines the bitwise XOR operation with assignment. It updates the variable by performing a bitwise XOR between its current value and another value. These operators are applied to integer types (Int, UInt, etc.) and provide a way to perform efficient, low-level bit manipulation in Swift. They are especially useful in scenarios where performance and direct hardware interaction are critical." }, { "title" : "Advantages of Swift Over Objective-C", "category" : "", "tags" : " Development, iOS, Programming, Swift, Objective-C", "url" : "/blog/swift-pros-over-obj-c", "date" : "October 18, 2021", "excerpt" : "Objective-C, developed in the early 1980s, has long been the backbone of iOS and macOS development.

Its deep integration with Apple’s ecosystem made it a preferred choice for developers working on these platforms for decades. However, with the introduction of Swift in 2014, Apple provided a modern alternative that addresses many of the limitations and complexities of Objective-C.Swift ProsSwift, designed from the ground up to be faster, safer, and more efficient, has quickly gained popularity among developers. It brings several significant improvements, including enhanced readability through a more concise and expressive syntax, superior performance optimizations that leverage modern hardware, and advanced safety features that help developers write more reliable code with fewer bugs. Swift’s design is influenced by modern programming paradigms, making it not only easier to learn for new developers but also more powerful for seasoned professionals looking to build robust and scalable applications.Moreover, Swift’s open-source nature has fostered a vibrant and growing community, contributing to its rapid evolution and adoption across various platforms beyond iOS and macOS, such as Linux and even Windows. This has expanded Swift’s appeal beyond traditional Apple developers to a broader audience, enhancing its ecosystem with a wealth of libraries, tools, and frameworks that further accelerate development and innovation. 1. Swift is Easier to Read and MaintainSwift eliminates many legacy conventions from Objective-C. For example, Swift does not require semicolons to end lines, and parentheses around conditional expressions are optional. This helps reduce the clutter of “bracket hell” in method calls. Additionally, Swift removes the need for two separate files (header and implementation); the LLVM compiler automatically figures out dependencies.Swift also embraces modern programming language features, such as using the + operator for string concatenation and string interpolation. This approach is both easier to read and less error-prone compared to Objective-C’s use of format specifiers like %s, %d, and %@, which can often lead to crashes.2. Swift Offers Better Safety and Memory ManagementIn Objective-C, calling a method on a nil pointer does nothing, which can lead to silent failures and unexpected behavior. Swift solves this problem with optional types, allowing developers to handle the absence of a value explicitly, thus avoiding many potential bugs.Unlike Objective-C, Swift’s Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) works across both object-oriented and procedural code. This reduces the cognitive load on developers, allowing them to focus on implementing core app logic rather than managing memory manually.3. Swift is Faster and Less Prone to Name CollisionsBenchmarks have consistently shown that Swift performs faster than Objective-C, thanks to its modern architecture and optimizations. An example of a benchmark conducted by Apple. Objective-C lacked native support for namespaces, often leading to name collisions that were traditionally avoided by prefixing class names (e.g., NSArray, NSString). In Swift, namespaces are automatically determined based on the module, allowing for more flexibility and fewer conflicts. For instance, both Apple and Google frameworks could contain a file named Authentication.swift without issue.4. Swift Supports Dynamic LibrariesWhile Objective-C only supports static libraries, Swift supports dynamic libraries, which can be loaded into an app’s memory at runtime. This capability reduces the overall size of an app and allows for faster load times for new, on-demand content.5. Swift is Open-Source with a Larger CommunitySwift’s open-source nature has fostered a large and active community. It has expanded beyond Apple’s ecosystem to other environments like Linux. For example, Vapor is a popular web framework for Swift. The Swift language is developed in the open, and all technical or administrative topics about the language or community processes should be directed to the Swift public forums. Public conversations are encouraged, and active developers of the Swift language should monitor the relevant forum categories.— Swift.orgAdditional Advantages of Swift Over Objective-CSwift offers several advanced features that enhance its utility and security over Objective-C: Type Safety and Optionals: Swift enforces strict type safety, reducing the risk of type-related errors that can lead to security vulnerabilities. Its use of optionals requires developers to handle nil values explicitly, minimizing the risk of runtime crashes or unexpected behavior, unlike Objective-C where nil values can silently fail. Memory Management: Both Swift and Objective-C use Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) for memory management, but Swift’s syntax and stricter rules make it easier to avoid common pitfalls like retain cycles and dangling pointers. Objective-C’s more permissive nature increases the potential for memory-related errors. Bounds Checking: Swift automatically performs bounds checking on arrays and collections, which helps prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities. In Objective-C, developers need to manually ensure that data access stays within valid bounds, increasing the risk of out-of-bounds errors. Immutable by Default: Swift encourages safer code by making constants (let) immutable by default. Objective-C requires the use of specific class types for immutability (e.g., NSString vs. NSMutableString), making the codebase more prone to unintended modifications if not carefully managed. Reduced Use of Unsafe Code: Swift avoids certain low-level operations, such as direct memory manipulation with pointers, that are more prevalent in Objective-C. This reduces the attack surface for exploits like buffer overflows and memory corruption. Enhanced Privacy and Security Practices: Swift’s language features align well with modern privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), supporting secure coding practices more intuitively and allowing developers to implement security measures more easily compared to Objective-C. These features make Swift a more secure choice for developing iOS applications, as it reduces common programming errors and provides built-in safeguards against many vulnerabilities." }, { "title" : "What is Swift Programming Language?", "category" : "", "tags" : " Development, iOS, Programming, Swift, Objective-C", "url" : "/blog/what-is-swift", "date" : "October 18, 2021", "excerpt" : "Swift is Apple’s modern, open-source programming language, introduced at Apple’s 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).

Designed to be the successor to Objective-C, Swift is used for developing applications across all of Apple’s platforms, including iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. It primarily works with Apple’s Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks. Since its introduction, Swift has rapidly become one of the fastest-growing programming languages. As an open-source language licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, Swift has extended beyond Apple’s ecosystem, finding use in other areas such as backend server development with frameworks like Vapor.Key Features of SwiftSwift was designed with several goals in mind: to be concise, expressive, fast, and less prone to errors (safer) than its predecessor, Objective-C. It introduces modern language features that make it easier to write reliable and maintainable code.The Architect of SwiftChris Lattner, the principal designer of Swift, was a key figure at Apple Inc., where he served as the Director of the Developer Tools department. In this role, he led the teams behind Xcode, Instruments, and the compiler technologies. Lattner is also the main author of LLVM (Low-Level Virtual Machine), a compiler infrastructure, and Clang, a compiler front end that replaces the GNU Compiler Collection and is designed to work atop LLVM. Chris Lattner (Twitter @clattner\\_llvm) Swift’s Versatility and Ease of LearningTo facilitate onboarding for newcomers, Swift can be used in various environments. One of the most accessible is the Swift Playgrounds, an interactive environment in Xcode, or through a web-based REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) like this one. A REPL provides a command-line interface that allows developers to experiment with Swift in an interpreted-like environment, making it easy to learn and test new code snippets quickly.Swift: A General-Purpose, Multi-Paradigm LanguageSwift is a type-safe, general-purpose, and multi-paradigm language. It supports a wide range of programming paradigms, including object-oriented, functional, and generic programming. This flexibility allows developers to use the most suitable style for a given problem, recognizing that no single paradigm is perfect for all use cases. Swift provides its own versions of common C and Objective-C types, alongside powerful data structures such as Arrays, Sets, and Dictionaries. Moreover, it includes unique types like tuples, which enable the passing of grouped values—a feature not available in Objective-C.Security &amp;amp; Swift/Objective-CWhile both Swift and Objective-C can be used to develop secure iOS applications, Swift offers several security advantages due to its modern language design: Type Safety and Optionals: Swift enforces strict type safety, reducing the risk of type-related errors that can lead to security vulnerabilities.

According to Swift.org, these include: The Swift compiler, a command-line tool for compiling Swift code. The Standard Library, which provides essential functionality and is bundled with the language. Core Libraries that offer higher-level capabilities. The LLDB Debugger, which includes the Swift REPL, enabling debugging and interactive coding. The Swift Package Manager, a tool for managing and building Swift projects. Xcode Playground Support, which enables the use of playgrounds in Xcode for interactive coding.Swift continues to evolve, driven by contributions from both Apple and the open-source community. Its combination of speed, safety, and expressiveness makes it a strong choice for developers looking to build modern applications across multiple platforms." } ,  { "title" : "About", "category" : "", "tags" : " Page", "url" : "/blog/about/", "date" : "N/A", "excerpt" : "Type on Strap is based on Type Theme, a free and open-source theme for Jekyll, licensed under the MIT License.Head over to the theme’s documentation for much more information about Type on Strap or to install this theme on your own Jekyll site.Thi...", "content" : "Type on Strap is based on Type Theme, a free and open-source theme for Jekyll, licensed under the MIT License.Head over to the theme’s documentation for much more information about Type on Strap or to install this theme on your own Jekyll site.This file is an example of a page in Jekyll, that automatically shows up in the header navigation, you can delete or modify this file freely." },      { "title" : "Portfolio", "category" : "", "tags" : " Page", "url" : "/blog/portfolio/", "date" : "N/A", "excerpt" : "", "content" : "" },   { "title" : "Tags", "category" : "", "tags" : " ", "url" : "/blog/tags/", "date" : "N/A", "excerpt" : "", "content" : "" },       { } ,{ "title" : "Ninja", "category" : "", "tags" : " Lorem", "url" : "/blog/portfolio/ninja", "date" : "April 8, 2014", "excerpt" : "Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo.
