I'm Deya Eldeen, a mechatronic engineer with a deep passion for programming 👨🏻‍💻, design, and engineering 🚀. This blog serves as a platform for me to share my insights and experiences related to Swift programming 🧐. Here, you'll find discussions on various topics, including algorithms, data structures, design patterns, and different programming paradigms.

## My Journey

My journey began at the age of 13 when I started creating 3D games using the Blender game engine. I worked as a full-time game developer throughout my college years, even before the advent of iPhone and Android. Today, I am proud to be a senior iOS Developer. 😀

## Roadmap for Swift Developers

Currently, I'm developing a roadmap for Swift developers to assist newcomers in the iOS/Swift ecosystem, covering all relevant software engineering topics. My goal is to create a comprehensive guide that covers the essential concepts and best practices for building robust and efficient iOS applications using Swift.

## Sharing Knowledge and Insights

Through this blog, I aim to share my knowledge and insights gained from years of experience in the field of iOS development. I believe that by sharing what I've learned, I can help other developers grow and improve their skills. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, I hope you find my articles informative and valuable.

## Feedback and Collaboration

I encourage you to reach out with any questions or feedback regarding my work. I'm always eager to learn from others and engage in discussions about the latest trends and best practices in iOS development. If you have a specific topic you'd like me to cover or if you'd like to collaborate on a project, please don't hesitate to contact me.
